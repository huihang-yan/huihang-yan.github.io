bzip2, bunzip2 \- a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.8
.br
bzcat \- decompresses files to stdout
.br
bzip2recover \- recovers data from damaged bzip2 files

.SH DESCRIPTION
bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting
text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is
generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
family of statistical compressors.

The command-line options are deliberately very similar to 
those of 
.I GNU gzip, 
but they are not identical.

.I bzip2
expects a list of file names to accompany the
command-line flags.  Each file is replaced by a compressed version of
itself, with the name "original_name.bz2".  
Each compressed file
has the same modification date, permissions, and, when possible,
ownership as the corresponding original, so that these properties can
be correctly restored at decompression time.  File name handling is
naive in the sense that there is no mechanism for preserving original
file names, permissions, ownerships or dates in filesystems which lack
these concepts, or have serious file name length restrictions, such as
MS-DOS.

The ideas embodied in
.I bzip2
are due to (at least) the following
people: Michael Burrows and David Wheeler (for the block sorting
transformation), David Wheeler (again, for the Huffman coder), Peter
Fenwick (for the structured coding model in the original
.I bzip,
and many refinements), and Alistair Moffat, Radford Neal and Ian Witten
(for the arithmetic coder in the original
.I bzip).  
I am much
indebted for their help, support and advice.  See the manual in the
source distribution for pointers to sources of documentation.  Christian
von Roques encouraged me to look for faster sorting algorithms, so as to
speed up compression.  Bela Lubkin encouraged me to improve the
worst-case compression performance.  
Donna Robinson XMLised the documentation.
The bz* scripts are derived from those of GNU gzip.
Many people sent patches, helped
with portability problems, lent machines, gave advice and were generally
helpful.
