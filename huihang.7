BANNER_HERE

.SH WELCOME

Greetings! I am delighted to welcome you to my
greenhouse - or should we say,
home page, a digital space
where I share my thoughts, stories, and passions,
or, should we say, 'drafts'.
.P
Yes,
drafts.
They are still a work in progress - so I
kindly ask for your understanding regarding
the quality issue.
If you have suggestions on how to
enhance the content, I would be
truly grateful to receive your feeback.
.P
Here, you will discover my blog content, or perhaps it's more accurate
to call it a collection of drafts. These are the works in progress,
the ideas still taking shape on the page.

I am not good at writing, but I am eager to enhance my abilities through
consistent writing and editing.
I will constantly review and revise the content I create,
since I could always discover areas that need improvement
several minutes/hours/days/months/years after my previous edit.

Often, I realise that a different word would better suit a particular context,
offering greater precision or simply being a more fitting choice. There
are times when I identify redundant words that should be removed, or
I spot typos and other errors.

For instance, I have mistakenly typed
'push request' instead of the correct term, 'pull request', and in another
case, I incorrectly used 'it' to refer to the plural 'blogs' - when 'they'
would have been the appropriate pronoun. These examples illustrate that I
frequently make writing errors, which is precisely why I am committed to
this process of continuous refinement.
.P
Therefore, please don't hesitate to share your advice with me.
I am always eager to heard your thoughts and suggestions and learn from you.
You can reach out to me via e-mail at the following address:

.P
You can also send pull requests via GitHub.
I would be glad
if my GitHub repo page gets crowded.
This page
is hosted on GitHub Pages.
Its corresponding GitHub repository
is public, so you can file issues and/or pull requests.
.P
Edit history is kept in the GitHub repository commits.
If you are curious what edits are made, you could
check them out at the repo page.
.
.SH DRAFT QUALITY
.
I write blogs mostly for fun and to the hope that they might help
other people in some way - at least they could be used as
English-as-second-language usage corpus for linguistics study.
That is, I do not take this really serious. I need to do other things
to survive in this world. As a result these blog articles might
be of really low quality, before they get edited and/or updated
days/weeks/months/years later after they are published here at the
first place.
.P
In other way, all stuff I put here shall be considered drafts.
Of draft quality, or we could say. But I believe that as time goes
by they would get better and better with edits and/or updates.
.P
I remember a saying that a good work does not come out at once, but
instead comes out with lots of edits. I remember that it is from
Hemingway.
I asked an AI for confirmation, and the AI told me some relevant
Hemingway quotes.
.P
The first one is: 'The only kind of writing is rewriting.'
.P
The second one is: 'All first drafts are shit.'
.P
The third one is: Modify
the works, 'removing the bullshit'.
.P
That AI also told me that: 'For example, he spent five months revising
A Farewell to Arms after finishing the first
darft in six months, and even made thirty nine
revisions to the last page.'
.P
I haven't further verify those things suggested by AI but they
sound real and I think I have heard of them before.
.P
Anyway, what I mean is - draft quality. Draft quality.

Here comes the end of the preface stuff.
Thanks for reading.

The following are blog articles - or should
we say, again, drafts. Drafts.

.SH ON BLOGGING
.  
I have decided to begin my new blog on GitHub Pages.
But why
GitHub Pages? Why not opt for other well-known
blogging platforms instead? And most importantly,
what are the distinct advantages that GitHub Pages offers?
.P
The biggest pros should be the ability to blog on the command-line.
GitHub
Pages is *designed* to be used on the command-line, while other blogging
platforms are usually not. Other blogging platforms usually provides
browser interface. Although we might end up being able to blog on
command-line with some scripting or something else, there might be issues,
and why not simply use GitHub Pages?
.P
Another unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version control thing. I
don't really need version control, but it's okay for me. I feel a bit
uneasy for the need of git-commit every time changes are made,
but at the same time I always check what I have edited with git-diff.
This is weird.

Availability is another factor to be considered. Besides GitHub Pages,
I know two other blog platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If my memory
is correct, Blogspot is a Google thing, and is thus - like other Google
thing - unavailable in the place I live in. I cannot connect to the
Wordpress website either. GitHub Pages is also unusable from time to time,
but is at least available *some times*, and the repository push-pull
are not blocked and always available, according to my experience.

.SH  Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?

GitHub is mainly designed to host code repositories, so I decided to
check twice whether we could blog in GitHub Pages.

Answer: 'You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects,
host a blog, or even share your resume.' This is mentioned in
Quickstart for GitHub Pages:
.RS
.P
.Text https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart
.RE
.
.
.P
So yes, we could use GitHub Pages as blog. That is great - especially
considering the fact that for some reason - probably due to the
national firewall - I could not connect to neither Blogspot nor
Wordpress.
.
.SH  PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING?
.
Maybe we could blog in plaintext only? - that is, providing pages
as a big `pre` HTML tag.
.P
No. This might be okay for users who prefer plain text like me,
but it would probably look extremely weird for most people. People
would feel that maybe it's something wrong with my blog page,
since it 'looks different from other websites/blogs'.
.P
I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have used Jekyll for one of my
previous blogs, and it's good enough - there is space for
improvement for everything, though.
.P
Wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with
.
.SH REASONS TO BLOG
.
But why should we write blogs? There are several compelling reasons.
.P
Firstly, for fun. Blogging offers a source of enjoyment. It provides
an outlet for self-expression, allowing us to explore our creativity,
share our passions, and engage with topics that bring us joy. Whether
it's writing about our hobbies, travel experiences, or personal
musings, the process of crafting a blog post can be a fulfilling and
entertaining activity in itself.
.P
Secondly, blogging serves as a powerful means of communication. By
sharing our thoughts, ideas and experiences, we give others a window
into our world, enabling them to know and understand us on a deeper
level. This increased transparency can foster stronger connections
with our readers, build trust, and open new opportunites. It could
lead to professional collaborations, new friendships, or a wider
network of like-minded individuals who share our interests and values.
.P
What's more, I myself have benefited a lot from the blogs written
by other people - from the beginning - when I firstly studied DOS
commands and C coding. By writing blogs myself, maybe I would help
other people - that's great, isn't it? Helping other people should
be great.
.P
Also: practice English writing. We often talk about 'practice writing',
but I found that the important part is editing. Editing. Many edits.
.P
I write in English, so I could practice English writing. But I guess
it's not very much about the language. Writing might be a universal,
language-independent skill, which does not confine to one certain language.
.P
It occured to me that when I wrote blogs before, I don't know how to
manage the size of one article. The result is that, I wrote lots of
really tiny 'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'? - no,
'snippet' is even longer - maybe 'cards' should be the right word.
.P
What I also did before is to edit Markdown texts in-line - in every line -
which produces git-diff results that are more difficult to read. This time
I find it great to minimise the git-diff results - since, anyway, the
target view would be the brew'd HTML, not the Markdown source text.
.
.SH JEKYLL
.
The posts are put in the `_posts` directory. They would automatically
update if we use `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and
auto-regenerates the site when a file is updated.
.P
`--livereload` is a really convenient feature which tells the browser to
refresh the page every time we have made an edit. With this option
specified, we won't need to refresh the page ourselves.
.P
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following
format:
.P
.RS
`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`
.RE
.P
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both
two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing
the format used in the file.
.P
It would be easier to just grab a existing source and take a look at the
format.
.P

def print_hi(name)

.SH  PLAIN-TEXT
.
Some reasons to use plain-text can be found in the book
TAOUP - The Art of Unix Programming, as well as the use-plain-text-email
website:
.P
.RS
useplaintext.email
.RE
.P
The use-plain-text-email site gives some really interesting points, but
those points are mainly for the context of e-mail:
.P
1. 72-column text for easier quoting.
.P
2. Phishing, marketing and spam e-mails use HTML. Plain-text emails can be
distinguished between them.
.P
3. HTML is an extensive standard, and its implementation often
gives rise to numerours vulnerabilities.
What's more, the vast array of features that HTML encompasses is
largely superfluous when it comes to the purpose of
email.
.P
4. HTML e-mail can contain hidden tracking stuff.
.P
5. HTML is less accessible, unless accessible is considered when writing.
.P
6. Some people use e-mail clients that support *only* plain-text e-mails.
.P
But I think there is one important reason behind. The typewriter tradition
of the western society.
.
.SH  PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING
.
The term plain-text is somewhat chaotic.
.P
At the very beginning there
are the typewriters, which usually only prints out mono-colour letters
and symbols. Typewriters support cursor movement, and therefore allowing
using the underscore and hyphen symbols to print out underline and
delete lines.
.P
Today's software terminal emulators offer underlining, but
strikethrough is not the same way widely supported. Many terminal
emulators adhere to the VT-100 'standard', which, in addition to underlining,
offers support for a number of colour, bold and italic formatting.
Consequently, man pages
make heavy use of underlined and bold text, and many distributions enable
the coloured output of the ls(1) program by default, along with numerous
other command-line software.
.P
An intriguing development is that some
people propose a yet another new standard that restricts colour
output based on the NO_COLOR environment variable. Take a look at
these two links:
.P
.RS
no-color.org
.br
github.com/jcs/no_color
.RE
.P
I typeset my blog with groff(1), the very same tool employed for
processing the
man-pages(7). This choice then prompts a series of questions: Should I
incorporate underlined and bold text, mirroring the formatting
commonly seen in man-pages(7)?
What about italic?
.P
No, I won't use these in my blog.
.P
The rational behind
this decision stems from my desire to ensure that
my blog remains fully accessible and legible across a diverse range
of plain-text
environments. For instance, the in-browser source-view
feature on GitHub lacks
support to underlined, italic and bold text.
.P
Additionally, I suspect
that some users may
have disabled such formatting options in their terminals, perhaps
due to personal preference.
Moreover, it's entirely possible that some
people are still using 'dumb terminals', which typically lacks support
for advanced text formatting.
.P
By avoiding these formatting
elements, I aim to create a blog that can be seamlessly viewed and
understood by as wide an audience as possible, regardless of the specific
viewing environment they use.
.P
The e-mail environment is also taken into consideration. Usually the
plain-text email doesn't include underline/italic/bold.
.P

.
.SH  RADIO
.
I love radio. This might sound weird, as today we have Internet, but
I would say that radio has its advantage - analog signal. I feel that
analog signal carries a sound of higher-quality than digital signal
- at least, a different feeling. What's more, analog signal is really
good for live/stream, since that even if there are distractions,
sound transmitted with analog signal would still preserve some of its
contents, while in the case of the digital signal packet loss usually
leads to simply vanity.
.P
Sometimes, while I am doing other thing, I come up with the feeling of 
turning on the radio. Then I do. But very soon later, I feel distracted
by the radio, and then feel like turning off the radio. It's like a
loop. I don't feel good about this. My current solution is simply not
to turn on the radio in the very beginning - since I would, according to
experience, feel like turning it off in the end.

.SH INTERPRETED/SCRIPTING LANGUAGES

Interpreted/scripting languages are good in the way that there is no
compilation - and therefore, no compile-time errors! Wow. Only run-time
errors.

What's more, there are no extra generated files to worry about.
Just the source files.

The problem of C/C++ is that they do not have the modern standard
libraries. They are born in the ages of the command-line interface,
and when the network standards have not yet been settled.

C/C++ have not standard library for GUI, network and even no
curses-like terminal functionality. All the things are file system
and line-oriented I/O - that is, only ed(1), even not vi(1).

At that time C is a good save for portability. However it's not
anymore true today. The lack of standard libraries result in
lack of portability.

Imagine when we develop a GUI program. If we are to use a GUI
toolkit, then the portability gets restricted by that GUI
toolkit. If we are to write it ourselves, people with other
environment would often find our program not working in their
boxes, due to the system-dependent code.

The good thing is that we have Qt, GTK and web browsers, which
provide a really full support to different environments, and
work as a good standard library - filling the gaps of the
standard library of C/C++.

Apart from giant solutions like Qt, GTK and web browsers,
it is also popular to solve this issue by writing a HTTP server
instead and let the user pick a browser to render the user
interface. This is smart.

However, this also requires a good
cross-platform network library. The good news is that a network
library is much smaller and there exist good ones.

.SH ROFF(7)/GROFF(1)/TROFF?

At first this blog is written directly in HTML. After some edits I
found it really tiring to redo the typesetting whenever I make some
edits - the line lengths would change, so if I am to edit one line,
I would in the end edit multiple lines to adjust the typesetting,
sometimes even the whole paragraph. So I turned to groff(1), and it
works great!

The roff(7) text formatting language syntax is really clear and easy to use.
I just grab a roff file from /usr/share/man/ - it was
/usr/share/man/man1/bzip2.1 - and I got my hands on. There are really
not much commands, just SS, SH and TH for the title stuff.

The only problem is that groff(1) generates output for the terminal,
so I need to sed(1) out the terminal escape sequences.

Now I just need to edit the roff(7) source and `make`. The output HTML
is also maintained by git(1), and it's really pleasant seeing
the git-diff updates automatically generated by groff(1). It beautiful.
Clear, neat and beautiful. And it doesn't hurt anything - if I were to
continue editing the HTML by hand as before, that would be the same
scene, with the only difference that the git-diff updates are typeset
by my hands, instead of automatically by groff(1).

groff(7) randomly resets the typesetting even for paragraphs that I
haven't touched. An AI told me that I can use the '.na' command to
disable justification in order to fix this. Let's see if it works ...

.SH THE ROFF FAMILY

The family of the roff type-setting system:

groff = GNU roff

troff: the *roff language* was historically called *troff*.

Texinfo: software documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both online information and printed output.

nroff: use groff to format documents for TTY devices.

	GNU _nroff_ emulates the traditional Unix _nroff_ command
using groff(1). _nroff_ generats output via grotty(1), _groff_'s TTY
output device.

troff.org: 'The Text Processor for Typesetters'

	'troff, and its GNU implementation `groff`, are programs that process
a textual description of a document to produce typeset verions suitable
for printing. It's more 'What you describe is what you get' rather than
WYSIWYG.'

	'The great strength of `troff` is the flexibility of the basic language
and its programmability - it can be made to do almost any formatting
task.'
.br
	-- The UNIX Programming Environment, Brian W. Kernighan and
Rob Pike.

.SH ROFF NOTES

The roff language is line-oriented. There are only two kinds of lines,
control lines and text lines. The control lines start with a control
character, by default a period '.' or a single quote `'`; all other
lines are text lines.

Command arguments are separated by spaces, but not tab characters.

For indentation, any number of space or tab characters can be inserted
between the leading control character and the command name, but
the control character must be on the first position of the line.

Escape sequence - backslash `\\'.

.Text '.P'

.Text '.I xxx' - italic

.Text '.' - a line consisting of a dot only, an 'empty roff(1)
request':

	'To additionally use the auto-fill mode in Emacs,
it is best to insert an
empty roff(1) request, a line consisting of a dot only, after each
sentence.'

	Thus, this dot-line appears to serve solely the purpose of
activating a certain auto-fill feature within Emacs, and seems to hold
no function in terms of typesetting, much like a comment line that
does not contribute to the actual execution or formatting of the
content.
Since I don't use Emacs, it stands to reason that I can safely overlook
this command without any adverse effects on my tasks related to
typesetting or otherwise.

.Text '.BR' - bold text?

Macro definition: '.de [macro]', then use '..' to end.

nop: '.nop [anything]' - always process [anything]

macro stuff: \)\\$*

	\\$*: the concatenation of all arguments separated by spaces

tab: if a tab character occurs during text, the interpreter makes a
horizontal jump to the next pre-defined tab position. There is a
sophisticated interface for handling tab positions.

.SH SPACING

An issue has been noticed when using Groff. It appears
that whenever there are alterations to a single line
within a paragraph, even when subsequent paragraphs
remain completely unchanged in terms of their content, their
spacing also gets modified.

Despite the text content in these paragraphs
remaining the same, the visible layout of the document
is affected.

This is very annoying when it comes together with git-diff.
I am wondering if this is a well-known or classical problem
within in the Groff community.

Well, it seems so. Let's check the man-page.
In the section EDITING ROFF:

.RS
All _roff_ formatters provide automated line breaks
and horizontal and vertical spacing. In order to not
disturb this, the following tips can be helpful.
.P
First of all, never include empty or blank lines in a
roff document. Instead, use the empty request,
i.e. a line consisting of a dot only, or
a line comment .\\" if a structuring element is
needed.
.P
Never start a line with whitespace
because this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
Indented paragraphs can be constructed
in a controlled way by roff requests.
.P
Start each sentence on a line of its
own, for the spacing after a dot
is handled differently depending
on whether it terminates an abbreviation
or a sentence.
To distinguish both cases, do a line
break after each sentence.
.
The following example shows a judicious
line breaking in a roff input file.
.

.P
.RS
.EX
This is an example of a
\&.I roff
document that you can type into your text editor.
\&.
This is the next sentence in the same paragraph.
\&.
This is a longer sentence stretching over several
input lines;
abbreviations like cf. are easily identified
because the dot is not followed by a
line break.
\&.
In the output, this sentence continues
the same paragraph.

.P
This might be the case.
There seems to have three things which
might cause problems.
.P
Firstly the blank lines.
It would 'disturb' the formatting?
.P
Secondly the line starting
with whitespace.
This can 'lead to unexpected behaviour'?
Well, weird.
Too weird.
Anyway, though it's weird,
let's try not step on this trap.
It's not that hard.
.P
Finally, start each sentence on
a line of its own.
\&'For the spacing after a dot is
handled differently depending on
whether it terminates an
abbreviation or a sentence.'
Well, this is also weird.
But anyway let's try to follow
this security advice too.
.P
.SH THEN HOW?
.P
Ok, now we have learnt from the possible
causes to that space-modifing issue.
Then what should we do?
.P
The only issue should be how to
separate paragraphs without using
black lines.
I check the roff sources of the
man-pages, and I see them use
\&'.P'.
I tried it and it works.
.P
Well, seems that we don't have
problems anymore.
But what exactly is
\&'.P'?
.P
I asked an AI and it told
me that the '.P' command is
used to start a new paragraph.
.P
The AI also told me that
there is an '.LP' command to
start a list paragraph,
and might add bullet points
and numbering.
That sounds good and useful.
.P
But where is '.P' command
mentioned in the man-pages?
Weird, can't find it.

.SH KAKAOTALK
.P
The registration requires the user to send an SMS, instead of receiving an
SMS from them.
.P
.SH PROTON MAIL
.P
Proton Mail also comes with a VPN. The limit of the free plan is
one connection.
.P
IMAP/SMTP: included with Mail Plus, Proton Unlimited and Proton for Business.
Need to upgrade.

That is, there is no access to IMAP/SMTP or something similar for the free
plan users. Got to upgrade if we would like to use Proton Mail in other
email clients. Anyway we could download its own email client.

.SH APPS

Proton VPN - haven't tried but I guess it works.

Proton Mail - for free plan, this is the only email client supporting
Proton Mail accounts.

.SH SINS AND VIRTUES

inspirationfeed.com

The seven cardinal sins: pride, greed, wrath, lust, envy,
gluttony and sloth.

Lust refers to an intense desire, usually to engage in illegal
or immoral sexual pleasure.

Gluttony refers to the overconsumption of food or anything
to the point of waste.

Greed is an intense desire and passionate love for
material wealth. Much like lust and gluttony, greed
results from an irrational longing for what you don't
need.

Sloth is laziness as is manifested by the willful
avoidance of work. It stems from the desire to
avoid responsibility. One adage that aptly captures
the sin of sloth is, 'those who do not work should not
eat.'

Wrath is simply uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage
or hatred. Wrath feeds on a strong desire to exact
vengeance and is often fueled by an irrational drive
to harm others.

Wrath counterparts: gentleness, self-control,
patience and peace.

Scriptural references: Colossians 3:8, Ephesians 4:26-27,
James 1:19-20, Proverbs 14:29 and 15:1, Psalm 37:8 and
Romans 12:19.

Envy is the desire for possessions, happiness as well
as the talents and abilities of others.

Pride is defined as an excessive love for oneself, belief
in one's abilities, the desire to excel everyone else.
Pride is such a vile sin that it has often
been considered as the root cause of the other
six of the seven cardinal sins.

The seven heavenly virtues: prudence, justice,
temperance, courage, faith, hope and charity.
