<name>SINS AND VIRTUES</name>

</t><t>
The seven cardinal sins: pride, greed, wrath, lust, envy,
gluttony and sloth.
</t><t>
Lust refers to an intense desire, usually to engage in illegal
or immoral sexual pleasure.
</t><t>
Gluttony refers to the overconsumption of food or anything
to the point of waste.
</t><t>
Greed is an intense desire and passionate love for
material wealth. Much like lust and gluttony, greed
results from an irrational longing for what you don't
need.
</t><t>
Sloth is laziness as is manifested by the willful
avoidance of work. It stems from the desire to
avoid responsibility. One adage that aptly captures
the sin of sloth is, 'those who do not work should not
eat.'
</t><t>
Wrath is simply uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage
or hatred. Wrath feeds on a strong desire to exact
vengeance and is often fueled by an irrational drive
to harm others.
</t><t>
Wrath counterparts: gentleness, self-control,
patience and peace.
</t><t>
Scriptural references: Colossians 3:8, Ephesians 4:26-27,
James 1:19-20, Proverbs 14:29 and 15:1, Psalm 37:8 and
Romans 12:19.
</t><t>
Envy is the desire for possessions, happiness as well
as the talents and abilities of others.
</t><t>
Pride is defined as an excessive love for oneself, belief
in one's abilities, the desire to excel everyone else.
Pride is such a vile sin that it has often
been considered as the root cause of the other
six of the seven cardinal sins.
</t><t>
The seven heavenly virtues: prudence, justice,
temperance, courage, faith, hope and charity.
</t>
      </section>

      <section><name>Focus</name>
      <t>Yes, we got to focus.</t>
      <t>We ask ourselves: does it harm when we listen to radio/music
         while working?</t>
      <t>Let's then ask ourselves: sometimes we hear interesting
      parts in radio/music. At that point, don't we feel that we
      *try* to listen to it? Yes, we paied our attention.</t>
      <t>But hey - does it harm? Yes. Absolutely. As we pay
      our attention elsewhere, we pay less attention on less work.
      Which means it equals to spending less time at work.
      Wow, that's bad.</t>
      <t>It makes the work time less measurable. We can't
      get an exact 'full-work' time, but full of interruptions.
      We don't know whether those interruptions are in great
      number
      or tiny.</t>
      <t>Actually, it *can* be in great number, just like how
      we have tried chatting in the same time as working.</t>

Learn how Niklas Luhmann, a prolific sociologist,
used Zettelkasten, or slip box, to organise his
ideas and boost his productivity.
Discover how to apply ...</t>
<t>
Like vinyl records and hardcover books,
Luhmann's original system was analog.
It consisted of numbered index cards,
or slips,
filed in six large cabinets.
Each slip contained a single and
complete idea, a concept
his followers call 'atomicity' ...</t>
<t>
Sometimes, what seems like relaxation is actually work.
For instance, choosing chess over
games as it has utility makes it less
relaxing.
Headaches vary, so it's personal.</t>
<t>
Here is a simple example that is plain to
you yet eluded me until now.
Can you share other such seemingly
obvious things other miss,
or ones you have overlooked while others
find them self-evident?
I am eager to know.</t>

Diligent pursuit of truth unlocks
knowledge that liberates.

<t>
This brings to mind a university English
class where our teacher asked
for English reads recommendation.
I proposed to the Bible, and the
teaching assistant asked me
how one should read Bible.</t>
<t>
Back then, I was
surprised by that question.
I found it odd, thinking 'Just
simply read it!'
But now, having
dipped into parts that piqued
my interest,
I now recognise the significance
of that query.
I have realised that reading whole
books, not fragments,
safeguards me from
missing out on any detail.
</t><t>
query: ['kwire], a question, especially
one addressed to an official or organisation
</t><t>
pique: [peek], verb, stimulate - interest or curiosity.
E.g. 'you have piqued my curiousity about the man'
</t><t>
odd: [ah-d] adjective: different
from what is usual or expected; strange.

I always will remember --		I was in no mood to trifle;

I went and shot the maximum		I tied them to my bumper and
The game laws would allow:		I drove them home somehow,
Two game wardens, seven hunters,	Two game wardens, seven hunters,
And a cow.				And a cow.

The Law was very firm, it		People ask me how I do it
Took away my permit--			And I say, "There's nothin' to it!
The worst punishment I ever endured.	You just stand there lookin' cute,
It turns out there was a reason:	And when something moves, you shoot."
Cows were out of season, and		And there's ten stuffed heads
One of the hunters wasn't insured.	In my trophy room right now:

      <name>THEN HOW?</name>
      <t>
Ok, now we have learnt from the possible
causes to that space-modifing issue.
Then what should we do?
      </t>
      <t>
The only issue should be how to
separate paragraphs without using
black lines.
I check the roff sources of the
man-pages, and I see them use
'.P'.
I tried it and it works.
      </t>
      <t>
Well, seems that we don't have
problems anymore.
But what exactly is
'.P'?
      </t>
      <t>
I asked an AI and it told
me that the '.P' command is
used to start a new paragraph.
      </t>
      <t>
The AI also told me that
there is an '.LP' command to
start a list paragraph,
and might add bullet points
and numbering.
That sounds good and useful.
      </t>
      <t>
But where is '.P' command
mentioned in the man-pages?
Weird, can't find it.
