I would use static method. Build static Jekyll site locally, then push
the built HTML/CSS/JS etc. files to the repo. The reason is that GitHub
Action might be problematic - e.g. when the GitHub server gets down ...

On the other side, the cons is that I would need to track the diff-s of
the *generated* HTML/CSS/JS etc. file. Absolutely more work than using
GitHub Action, which hides the generated site files behind the scene.

Why are there *still* environments where only CLIs are available, and GUIs
are unavailable?

Those environments are usually enterprise computers/servers, and similar
cases like the computers/servers of some organisation - e.g. an NGO,
a hospital, some government department, schools etc. In those environments,
the system admin would often *refuse* to install GUI stuff for various
reasons:

1. CLI is sufficient for the task that those machines are designed to do,
and extra packages result in
extra work of the system admin. If the GUI programs are installed, the
system admin would need to update them - which is extra work. The GUI
programs would take up disk space and drop files, like configuration
files in home folders and `/etc`, getting in the way of the system admin's
maintaince work.

2. Introduce more security vulnerabilities.

In short: 1. GUI is unnecessary for those machine, and 2. GUI introduce more
problems.
