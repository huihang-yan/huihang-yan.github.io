WELCOME
       Welcome  to  my  greenhouse/home page: a drafty space
       for thoughts, stories, passions.

       Yes, drafts - work in  progress.   Please  understand
       the quality.  Grateful for suggestions.

       Here,  you  will discover my blog content, or perhaps
       it's more accurate to call it a collection of drafts.
       These  are  the  works  in  progress, the ideas still
       taking shape on the page.

       Not a good writer, but eager to improve.   Will  keep
       writing,  editing, reviewing, and revising - there is
       always room for improvement.  Always find  areas  for
       improvement,  from  minutes,  hours,  days, months to
       years post-edit.

       Often, I realise that a different word  would  better
       suit a particular context, offering greater precision
       or simply being a  more  fitting  choice.  There  are
       times  when I identify redundant words that should be
       removed, or I spot typos and other errors.

       For  instance,  I  have  mistakenly  typed  case,   I
       incorrectly  used 'it' to refer to the plural 'blogs'
       -  when  'they'  would  have  been  the   appropriate
       pronoun.  These examples illustrate that I frequently
       make writing errors, which  is  precisely  why  I  am
       committed to this process of continuous refinement.

       Therefore, please don't hesitate to share your advice
       with me.  I am always eager to  heard  your  thoughts
       and  suggestions  and  learn from you.  You can reach
       out to me via e-mail:

              huihang.yan@outlook.com

       You can also send pull requests via GitHub.  I  would
       be  glad  if  my GitHub repo page gets crowded.  This
       page is hosted on GitHub  Pages.   Its  corresponding
       GitHub  repository  is public, so you can file issues
       and/or pull requests.

       Edit  history  is  kept  in  the  GitHub   repository
       commits.  If you are curious what edits are made, you
       could check them out at the repo page.

DRAFT QUALITY
       I write blogs mostly for fun and  to  the  hope  that
       they  might  help other people in some way - at least
       they  could  be  used  as  English-as-second-language
       usage  corpus  for  linguistics study.  That is, I do
       not take this really serious.  I  need  to  do  other
       things  to  survive  in this world. As a result these
       blog articles might be of really low quality,  before
       they       get       edited       and/or      updated
       days/weeks/months/years   later   after   they    are
       published here at the first place.

       In   other  way,  all  stuff  I  put  here  shall  be
       considered drafts.  Of draft  quality,  or  we  could
       say.  But  I  believe that as time goes by they would
       get better and better with edits and/or updates.

       I remember a saying that a good work  does  not  come
       out  at  once,  but  instead  comes  out with lots of
       edits. I remember that it is from Hemingway.  I asked
       an  AI  for  confirmation,  and  the  AI told me some
       relevant Hemingway quotes.

       The first one  is:  'The  only  kind  of  writing  is
       rewriting.'

       The second one is: 'All first drafts are shit.'

       The  third  one  is:  Modify the works, 'removing the
       bullshit'.

       That AI also told me that:  'For  example,  he  spent
       five   months  revising  A  Farewell  to  Arms  after
       finishing the first draft in  six  months,  and  even
       made thirty nine revisions to the last page.'

       I haven't further verify those things suggested by AI
       but they sound real and I think I have heard of  them
       before.

       Anyway,  what  I  mean  is  -  draft  quality.  Draft
       quality.

END OF FRONTMATTER
       Here comes the end of the preface stuff.  Thanks  for
       reading.

       The  following  are blog articles - or should we say,
       again, drafts. Drafts.

ON BLOGGING
       I have decided to begin my new blog on GitHub  Pages.
       But  why  GitHub  Pages?  Why not opt for other well-
       known   blogging   platforms   instead?   And    most
       importantly,  what  are  the distinct advantages that
       GitHub Pages offers?

       The biggest pros should be the ability to blog on the
       command-line.   GitHub Pages is *designed* to be used
       on the command-line, while other  blogging  platforms
       are  usually  not.  Other  blogging platforms usually
       provides browser interface. Although we might end  up
       being   able   to  blog  on  command-line  with  some
       scripting or something else, there might  be  issues,
       and why not simply use GitHub Pages?

       Another unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version
       control thing. I don't really need  version  control,
       but  it's  okay  for  me. I feel a bit uneasy for the
       need of git-commit every time changes are  made,  but
       at  the  same  time I always check what I have edited
       with git-diff.  This is weird.

       Availability is  another  factor  to  be  considered.
       Besides   GitHub   Pages,   I  know  two  other  blog
       platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If  my  memory  is
       correct,  Blogspot  is  a Google thing, and is thus -
       like other Google thing - unavailable in the place  I
       live  in.  I  cannot connect to the Wordpress website
       either. GitHub Pages is also unusable  from  time  to
       time, but is at least available *some times*, and the
       repository  push-pull  are  not  blocked  and  always
       available, according to my experience.


Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?
       GitHub  is mainly designed to host code repositories,
       so I decided to check twice whether we could blog  in
       GitHub Pages.

       Answer:  'You  can  use GitHub Pages to showcase some
       open source projects, host a blog, or even share your
       resume.'  This  is mentioned in Quickstart for GitHub
       Pages:

              https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

       So yes, we could use GitHub Pages as  blog.  That  is
       great - especially considering the fact that for some
       reason - probably due to the national  firewall  -  I
       could not connect to neither Blogspot nor Wordpress.

PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING?
       Maybe  we  could  blog  in plaintext only? - that is,
       providing pages as a big `pre` HTML tag.

       No. This might be okay for  users  who  prefer  plain
       text  like  me,  but it would probably look extremely
       weird for most people. People would feel  that  maybe
       it's  something  wrong  with  my  blog page, since it
       'looks different from other websites/blogs'.

       I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have  used  Jekyll
       for  one of my previous blogs, and it's good enough -
       there  is  space  for  improvement  for   everything,
       though.

       Wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with

REASONS TO BLOG
       But  why  should  we  write  blogs? There are several
       compelling reasons.

       Firstly,  for  fun.  Blogging  offers  a  source   of
       enjoyment. It provides an outlet for self-expression,
       allowing us to  explore  our  creativity,  share  our
       passions,  and  engage with topics that bring us joy.
       Whether  it's  writing  about  our  hobbies,   travel
       experiences,  or  personal  musings,  the  process of
       crafting  a  blog  post  can  be  a  fulfilling   and
       entertaining activity in itself.

       Secondly,  blogging  serves  as  a  powerful means of
       communication. By sharing  our  thoughts,  ideas  and
       experiences,  we give others a window into our world,
       enabling them to know and understand us on  a  deeper
       level.   This   increased   transparency  can  foster
       stronger connections with our readers,  build  trust,
       and   open   new   opportunites.  It  could  lead  to
       professional collaborations, new  friendships,  or  a
       wider  network  of  like-minded individuals who share
       our interests and values.

       What's more, I myself have benefited a lot  from  the
       blogs  written by other people - from the beginning -
       when I firstly studied DOS commands and C coding.  By
       writing blogs myself, maybe I would help other people
       - that's great, isn't it? Helping other people should
       be great.

       Also:  practice  English writing. We often talk about
       'practice writing', but I found  that  the  important
       part is editing. Editing. Many edits.

       I  write  in  English,  so  I  could practice English
       writing. But I guess it's not  very  much  about  the
       language.  Writing  might  be  a universal, language-
       independent skill, which  does  not  confine  to  one
       certain language.

       It  occured  to  me that when I wrote blogs before, I
       don't know how to manage the size of one article. The
       result   is   that,  I  wrote  lots  of  really  tiny
       'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'?  -
       no,

       What  I also did before is to edit Markdown texts in-
       line -  in  every  line  -  which  produces  git-diff
       results  that are more difficult to read. This time I
       find it great to  minimise  the  git-diff  results  -
       since,  anyway,  the  target view would be the brew'd
       HTML, not the Markdown source text.

JEKYLL
       The posts are put in  the  `_posts`  directory.  They
       would  automatically update if we use `jekyll serve`,
       which launches a web server and auto-regenerates  the
       site when a file is updated.

       `--livereload`  is  a really convenient feature which
       tells the browser to refresh the page every  time  we
       have  made  an  edit.  With this option specified, we
       won't need to refresh the page ourselves.

       Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according
       to the following format:

              `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

       Where  `YEAR`  is  a  four-digit  number, `MONTH` and
       `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the
       file  extension  representing  the format used in the
       file.

       It would be easier to just grab a existing source and
       take a look at the format.

       Code snippets syntax in Jekyll:

              {% highlight ruby %}
              def print_hi(name)
                 puts "Hi, #{name}"
              end
              print_hi('Tom')
              #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
              {% endhighlight %}

PLAIN-TEXT
       Some reasons to use plain-text can be  found  in  the
       book  TAOUP - The Art of Unix Programming, as well as
       the use-plain-text-email website:

              useplaintext.email

       The use-plain-text-email site gives some  really  in-
       teresting points, but those points are mainly for the
       context of e-mail:

       1. 72-column text for easier quoting.

       2. Phishing, marketing and  spam  e-mails  use  HTML.
       Plain-text emails can be distinguished between them.

       3. HTML is an extensive standard, and its implementa-
       tion often gives rise to  numerours  vulnerabilities.
       What's more, the vast array of features that HTML en-
       compasses is largely superfluous when it comes to the
       purpose of email.

       4. HTML e-mail can contain hidden tracking stuff.

       5. HTML is less accessible, unless accessible is con-
       sidered when writing.

       6. Some people use e-mail clients that support *only*
       plain-text e-mails.

       But I think there is one important reason behind. The
       typewriter tradition of the western society.

PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING
       The term plain-text is somewhat chaotic.

       At the very  beginning  there  are  the  typewriters,
       which usually only prints out mono-colour letters and
       symbols. Typewriters  support  cursor  movement,  and
       therefore  allowing  using  the underscore and hyphen
       symbols to print out underline and delete lines.

       Today's software terminal emulators  offer  underlin-
       ing,  but  strikethrough  is  not the same way widely
       supported. Many  terminal  emulators  adhere  to  the
       VT-100 'standard', which, in addition to underlining,
       offers support for  a  number  of  colour,  bold  and
       italic  formatting.   Consequently,  man  pages  make
       heavy use of underlined and bold text, and many  dis-
       tributions  enable  the  coloured output of the ls(1)
       program by default, along with  numerous  other  com-
       mand-line software.

       An intriguing development is that some people propose
       a yet another new standard that restricts colour out-
       put  based on the NO_COLOR environment variable. Take
       a look at these two links:

              no-color.org
              github.com/jcs/no_color

       I typeset my blog with groff(1), the very  same  tool
       employed for processing the man-pages(7). This choice
       then prompts a series of questions: Should I incorpo-
       rate  underlined and bold text, mirroring the format-
       ting  commonly  seen  in  man-pages(7)?   What  about
       italic?

       No, I won't use these in my blog.

       The  rational  behind this decision stems from my de-
       sire to ensure that my blog remains fully  accessible
       and  legible across a diverse range of plain-text en-
       vironments. For instance, the in-browser  source-view
       feature on GitHub lacks support to underlined, italic
       and bold text.

       Additionally, I suspect that some users may have dis-
       abled  such  formatting  options  in their terminals,
       perhaps due to personal preference.   Moreover,  it's
       entirely  possible  that  some people are still using
       'dumb terminals', which typically lacks  support  for
       advanced text formatting.

       By  avoiding these formatting elements, I aim to cre-
       ate a blog that can be seamlessly viewed  and  under-
       stood  by as wide an audience as possible, regardless
       of the specific viewing environment they use.

       The e-mail environment is also taken into  considera-
       tion.  Usually  the  plain-text email doesn't include
       underline/italic/bold.

RADIO
       I love radio. This might sound  weird,  as  today  we
       have Internet, but I would say that radio has its ad-
       vantage - analog signal. I feel  that  analog  signal
       carries a sound of higher-quality than digital signal
       - at least, a different feeling. What's more,  analog
       signal  is  really  good  for live/stream, since that
       even if there  are  distractions,  sound  transmitted
       with  analog  signal would still preserve some of its
       contents, while in the case  of  the  digital  signal
       packet loss usually leads to simply vanity.

       Sometimes,  while  I  am doing other thing, I come up
       with the feeling of turning on the radio. Then I  do.
       But  very soon later, I feel distracted by the radio,
       and then feel like turning off the radio. It's like a
       loop.  I don't feel good about this. My current solu-
       tion is simply not to turn on the radio in  the  very
       beginning  -  since I would, according to experience,
       feel like turning it off in the end.

QUOTES
       Here  are  quotes,  which  I believe are from ancient
       Chinese, and probably Confucius:

              1. Do not do to others what you  do  not  want
              others to do to you.

              2.  Turn  inward and examine yourself when you
              encounter difficulties in life.

              3. Repay kindness with kindness.

       Here are some other quotes:

              Do not confuse knowledge with  wisdom:  knowl-
              edge teachs you to earn a living, while wisdom
              ensures that life is worth living.

              Surround yourself with  those  who  appreciate
              your  unique  qualities,  not those who try to
              diminish them.

              Life shines brightly, and  every  creature  is
              delightful.

              A low-quality circle will do and say all sorts
              of things to destroy your ambition.

              I am often asked why I am handsome.  Truth is,
              I  come  from a good-looking family.  But many
              say I have a babyface.

       Here `circle' stands for social circle  -  people  we
       talk/meet/have fun/hang out with etc.

       Albert Camus wrote that the only serious question  is
       whether  to  kill  yourself or not. Tom Robbins wrote
       that the only serious question is whether time has  a
       beginning  and  an  end.  Camus clearly got up on the
       wrong side of bed, and Robbins must have forgotten to
       set the alarm.

       The  nice  thing about standards is that there are so

       Dear Sir:
       Your  name  has been submitted to us with your photo.
       I regret to inform you that we will be unable to  use
       your  body  in  our centerfold.  On a scale of one to
       ten, your body was rated a minus two by  a  panel  of
       women  ranging  in age from 60 to 75 years.  We tried
       to assemble a panel in the age bracket of  25  to  35
       years,  but  we  could  not get them to stop laughing
       long enough to reach a decision.  Should the taste of
       the  American  woman  ever change so drastically that
       bodies such as yours would be appropriate in our mag-
       azine,  you will be notified by this office.  Please,
       don't call us.

       Sympathetically,
       Amanda L. Smith

       p.s. We also want to commend  you  for  your  unusual
       pose.   Were  you  wounded in the war, or do you ride
       your bike a lot?

INTERPRETED/SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
       Interpreted/scripting  languages  are good in the way
       that there is no compilation - and therefore, no com-
       pile-time errors!  Wow.  Only run-time errors.

       What's  more,  there  are no extra generated files to
       worry about.  Just the source files.

       The problem of C/C++ is that they  do  not  have  the
       modern standard libraries.  They are born in the ages
       of the command-line interface, and when  the  network
       standards have not yet been settled.

       C/C++  have not standard library for GUI, network and
       even no curses-like terminal functionality.  All  the
       things  are  file system and line-oriented I/O - that
       is, only ed(1), even not vi(1).

       At that time C is a good save for portability.   How-
       ever  it's not anymore true today.  The lack of stan-
       dard libraries result in lack of portability.

       Imagine when we develop a GUI program.  If we are  to
       use  a  GUI  toolkit,  then  the portability gets re-
       stricted by that GUI toolkit.  If we are to write  it
       ourselves,  people with other environment would often
       find our program not working in their boxes,  due  to
       the system-dependent code.

       The  good  thing  is  that  we  have  Qt, GTK and web
       browsers, which provide a really full support to dif-
       ferent  environments, and work as a good standard li-
       brary - filling the gaps of the standard  library  of
       C/C++.

       Apart  from  giant  solutions  like  Qt,  GTK and web
       browsers, it is also popular to solve this  issue  by
       writing a HTTP server instead and let the user pick a
       browser to render the user interface. This is smart.

       However, this also  requires  a  good  cross-platform
       network library.  The good news is that a network li-
       brary is much smaller and there exist good ones.

ROFF(7)/GROFF(1)/TROFF?
       At first this blog is written directly in HTML.   Af-
       ter  some  edits I found it really tiring to redo the
       typesetting whenever I make some  edits  -  the  line
       lengths  would change, so if I am to edit one line, I
       would in the end edit multiple lines  to  adjust  the
       typesetting,  sometimes even the whole paragraph.  So
       I turned to groff(1), and it works great!

       The roff(7) text formatting language syntax is really
       clear  and easy to use.  I just grab a roff file from
       /usr/share/man/ - it was  /usr/share/man/man1/bzip2.1
       -  and  I got my hands on.  There are really not much
       commands, just SS, SH and TH for the title stuff.

       The only problem is that  groff(1)  generates  output
       for  the terminal, so I need to sed(1) out the termi-
       nal escape sequences.

       Now I just  need  to  edit  the  roff(7)  source  and
       `make`.   The  output  HTML  is  also  maintained  by
       git(1), and it's really pleasant seeing the  git-diff
       updates  automatically  generated  by groff(1).  It's
       beautiful.   Clear,  neat  and  beautiful.   And   it
       doesn't hurt anything - if I were to continue editing
       the HTML by hand as before, that would  be  the  same
       scene, with the only difference that the git-diff up-
       dates are typeset by my hands, instead  of  automati-
       cally by groff(1).

       groff(7)  randomly  resets  the  typesetting even for
       paragraphs that I haven't touched.   An  AI  told  me
       that  I can use the '.na' command to disable justifi-
       cation in order to fix this.  Let's see if  it  works
       ...

THE ROFF FAMILY
       The family of the roff type-setting system:

       groff = GNU roff

       troff:  the  *roff  language* was historically called
       *troff*.

       Texinfo: software documentation system  that  uses  a
       single source file to produce both online information
       and printed output.

       nroff: use groff to format documents for TTY devices.

              GNU  _nroff_  emulates  the  traditional  Unix
              _nroff_  command using groff(1).  _nroff_ gen-
              erats output via grotty(1), _groff_'s TTY out-
              put device.

       troff.org: 'The Text Processor for Typesetters'

              'troff,  and  its  GNU implementation `groff`,
              are programs that process a  textual  descrip-
              tion  of a document to produce typeset verions
              suitable for printing.  It's  more  'What  you
              describe  is  what  you get' rather than WYSI-
              WYG.'

              'The great strength of `troff` is  the  flexi-
              bility  of  the  basic  language  and its pro-
              grammability - it can be made to do almost any
              formatting task.'
                     -- The UNIX Programming Environment,
                        Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike.

ROFF NOTES
       The  roff  language is line-oriented.  There are only
       two kinds of lines, control  lines  and  text  lines.
       The  control lines start with a control character, by
       default a period '.' or a single quote `'`; all other
       lines are text lines.

       Command  arguments  are  separated by spaces, but not
       tab characters.

       For indentation, any number of space or  tab  charac-
       ters  can  be  inserted  between  the leading control
       character and the command name, but the control char-
       acter must be on the first position of the line.

       Escape sequence - backslash `\'.

       '.P'

       '.I xxx' - italic

       '.'  -  a  line  consisting  of a dot only, an 'empty
       roff(1) request':

            'To  additionally  use  the  auto-fill  mode  in
       Emacs, it is best to insert an empty roff(1) request,
       a line consisting of a  dot  only,  after  each  sen-
       tence.'

            Thus,  this dot-line appears to serve solely the
       purpose of activating  a  certain  auto-fill  feature
       within  Emacs, and seems to hold no function in terms
       of typesetting, much like a comment  line  that  does
       not  contribute to the actual execution or formatting
       of the content.  Since I don't use Emacs,  it  stands
       to  reason  that  I  can safely overlook this command
       without any adverse effects on my  tasks  related  to
       typesetting or otherwise.

       '.BR' - bold text?

       Macro  definition:  '.de  [macro]',  then use '..' to
       end.

       nop: '.nop [anything]' - always process [anything]

       macro stuff: \)\\$*

              \$*: the concatenation of all arguments  sepa-
              rated by spaces

       However, when `\$' appears alone, it stands as a sin-
       gle-character escapes, resulting in a  non-printable,
       zero-width glyph.

       This  nature makes it suitable for the purpose of be-
       ing put at the start of a line to prevent the  `real'
       beginning  character  to  be parsed as commands.  For
       example, when we really need to write something  that
       begins  with  the  dot, instead of trying to enter an
       groff command.

       tab: if a tab character occurs during text,  the  in-
       terpreter makes a horizontal jump to the next pre-de-
       fined tab position.  There is a sophisticated  inter-
       face for handling tab positions.

       Tabbed/indent example code snippet:
              .RS
              .EX
              $ code here, automatically indented
              .EE
              .RE

       .RS:  reduce  space.  Start a block of indented text.
       Creates a new indentation level. `.RS n`  to  specify
       the indentation value.

       .EX: start an example block.

       .SS: subsection, like .SN, though .SS further indents
       - that's why its called _sub_section.

       List:
              .TP
              .B item1
              blah blah

SPACING
       An issue has been noticed when using  Groff.  It  ap-
       pears that whenever there are alterations to a single
       line within a paragraph, even when  subsequent  para-
       graphs  remain completely unchanged in terms of their
       content, their spacing also gets modified.

       Despite the text content in these paragraphs  remain-
       ing  the  same, the visible layout of the document is
       affected.

       This is very annoying when  it  comes  together  with
       git-diff.   I am wondering if this is a well-known or
       classical problem within in the Groff community.

       Well, it seems so. Let's check the man-page.  In  the
       section EDITING ROFF:

              All  _roff_  formatters provide automated line
              breaks and horizontal and vertical spacing. In
              order  to not disturb this, the following tips
              can be helpful.

              First of all, never  include  empty  or  blank
              lines  in  a  roff  document. Instead, use the
              empty request, i.e. a line consisting of a dot
              only,  or  a line comment .\" if a structuring
              element is needed.

              Never start a  line  with  whitespace  because
              this  can  lead  to unexpected behaviour.  In-
              dented paragraphs can be constructed in a con-
              trolled way by roff requests.

              Start  each sentence on a line of its own, for
              the spacing after a dot is handled differently
              depending on whether it terminates an abbrevi-
              ation or  a  sentence.   To  distinguish  both
              cases,  do  a  line break after each sentence.
              The following example shows a  judicious  line
              breaking in a roff input file.

                     This is an example of a
                     .I roff
                     document that you can type into your text editor.
                     .
                     This is the next sentence in the same paragraph.
                     .
                     This is a longer sentence stretching over several
                     input lines;
                     abbreviations like cf. are easily identified
                     because the dot is not followed by a
                     line break.
                     .
                     In the output, this sentence continues
                     the same paragraph.

       This  might  be  the case.  There seems to have three
       things which might cause problems.

       Firstly the blank lines.  It would 'disturb' the for-
       matting?

       Secondly the line starting with whitespace.  This can
       'lead to unexpected behaviour'?   Well,  weird.   Too
       weird.  Anyway, though it's weird, let's try not step
       on this trap.  It's not that hard.

       Finally, start each sentence on a line  of  its  own.
       'For  the  spacing after a dot is handled differently
       depending on whether it terminates an abbreviation or
       a  sentence.'   Well, this is also weird.  But anyway
       let's try to follow this security advice too.

SEMBR
       Semantic line breaks.  Yes, that's the term.

       I remember seeing it  for  Markdown  stuff.   Haven't
       thought  it would even really work in this case - and
       as such an important role - in roff(7).

       See sembr.org.

              Semantic Line Breaks describe a set of conven-
              tions  for  using  insensitive vertical white-
              space to structure prose along semantic bound-
              aries.  Many lightweight markup languages, in-
              cluding Markdown, reStructured Text, and Asci-
              iDoc, join ...

       Also see:
              writingslowly.com/
                     semantic-line-breaks-are-a.html

              Semantic  line  breaks  are a feature of Mark-
              down, not a bug

              As the semantic line break specification  sug-
              gests,  by  inserting  line breaks at semantic
              boundaries, writers, editors, and  other  col-
              laborators can make source text easier to work
              with, without affecting how it's seen by read-
              ers.

A COMMENT
       A  commenter  claimed the Markdown line-break conven-
       tion was a compromise to  appease  conflicting  stan-
       dards.   They  found  it  infuriating  - obviously, a
       Markdown line-break should equal a real one.

       They also hate the Markdown bold and italic text con-
       ventions.  To them, single asterisks should mark bold
       text, single underscores italic.  Simple as that.

       I find these designs natural and good.   The  comment
       surprised me, and I want to respond to it.

       People  wonder  why  not  `real' newlines.  One major
       reason is to enable easy line-based diffs, like those
       in  git-diff,  patch(1) and other version control and
       collaboration  tools.   Recall  when   patches   were
       emailed.

       Using  `real'  newlines means a tiny edit can spawn a
       huge diff(1) result.

       Sounds  abstract?  Check  the  commit  histories   of
       GitHub-hosted  GitHub  Pages  sites, plain-text docu-
       ments, or Markdown files.

       Many don't use version control  or  collaborate  with
       old-school Unix tools like diff(1) and patch(1).  But
       that's a large portion of the worlds of Markdown  and
       Unix.

       The  Markdown  line-break  convention  feels natural.
       It's the norm in Roff, LaTeX, RST  and  HTML.   Check
       HTML source - same deal.  That's just how it is.

       Look  at  Unix-world plain text docs.  Nearly all are
       formatted a certain way.  Take two Slackware docs  as
       an  example.   There  are countless more - LFS, TLDP,
       Python PEPs, Python RST docs, Linux kernel docs,  RFC
       sources.  They are everywhere.

              ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/
                  slackware64-15.0/
                      Slackware-HOWTO
                      usb-and-pxe-istallers/README_USB.TXT

       And  I forgot the plain text emails - yes, just check
       any maillist, either  ArchLinux,  Debian,  Slackware,
       Gentoo ...  Majority of the mails are line-broke this
       way.

       So the result is - for people of certain  background,
       this  feels  just natural. But for others, this might
       feel weird.

       Historical context helps.  Word-wrap was not  common.
       Open  vi(1)  or  vim(1), and you will see it's off by
       default.  Sure, some distros like Ubuntu  might  pro-
       vide a nice good default `.vimrc', trying to be user-
       friendly like Windows.  But that's not  the  standard
       way.

       Without a common word-wrap feature, manual line-wrap-
       ping became a habit and standard.  People do  it  be-
       cause  some  editors  do not auto-warp.  Skip it, and
       the next turns into a jumbled mess.

       And for the asterik part, I shall say that underscore
       is for underline.

       Well, while editing the above, I found that I want to
       write something completely different.

       No  question,  Markdown is annoying.  Ditching it was
       my best move.  Its charm, the good looks in raw form,
       became  its  downfall.   I had to constantly preserve
       that aesthetic.

       Besides this, I am convinced it's impossible to  com-
       bine raw-file attractiveness with full functionality;
       they are mutually exclusive.  When we strive for more
       functions in Markdown, the result is usually a worse-
       looking raw file.

       Now I use roff(7).  Maybe you have never heard of it,
       but  odds  are  you  have  used it without realising,
       since it formats man-pages(7).  By  sacrificing  raw-
       file  prettiness,  it  simplifies my life, leaving me
       content and free from Markdown's demands.

       However, I want to talk the line-breaking style.  Its
       key  advantage lies in version control, where it gen-
       erates more concise diffs, making  it  effortless  to
       review  edits upon sign-off.  This benefit extends to
       collaboration  as  well;  when  sharing  patches  via
       email,  it  streamlines the process and saves others'
       time.

       very text that I am editing:

       Manually  placing  new-lines shrinks diff(1) results.

GACHA
THEN HOW?
       Ok,  now  we  have learnt from the possible causes to
       that space-modifing issue.  Then what should we do?

       The only issue should be how to  separate  paragraphs
       without  using black lines.  I check the roff sources
       of the man-pages, and I see them use '.P'.   I  tried
       it and it works.

       Well, seems that we don't have problems anymore.  But
       what exactly is '.P'?

       I asked an AI and it told me that the '.P' command is
       used to start a new paragraph.

       The AI also told me that there is an '.LP' command to
       start a list paragraph, and might add  bullet  points
       and numbering.  That sounds good and useful.

       But where is '.P' command mentioned in the man-pages?
       Weird, can't find it.

       That is, there is no access to IMAP/SMTP or something

SINS AND VIRTUES
       inspirationfeed.com

       The  seven  cardinal sins: pride, greed, wrath, lust,
       envy, gluttony and sloth.

       Lust refers to an intense desire, usually  to  engage
       in illegal or immoral sexual pleasure.

       Gluttony  refers  to  the  overconsumption of food or
       anything to the point of waste.

       Greed is an intense desire and  passionate  love  for
       material  wealth.  Much like lust and gluttony, greed
       results from an irrational longing for what you don't
       need.

       Sloth  is  laziness  as  is manifested by the willful
       avoidance of work. It stems from the desire to  avoid
       responsibility. One adage that aptly captures the sin
       of sloth is, 'those who do not work should not eat.'

       Wrath is simply uncontrolled feelings of anger,  rage
       or  hatred.  Wrath  feeds on a strong desire to exact
       vengeance and is often fueled by an irrational  drive
       to harm others.

       Wrath  counterparts:  gentleness,  self-control,  pa-
       tience and peace.

       Scriptural  references:  Colossians  3:8,   Ephesians
       4:26-27,  James  1:19-20,  Proverbs  14:29  and 15:1,
       Psalm 37:8 and Romans 12:19.

       Envy is the desire for possessions, happiness as well
       as the talents and abilities of others.

       Pride  is  defined  as an excessive love for oneself,
       belief in one's abilities, the desire to excel every-
       one else.  Pride is such a vile sin that it has often
       been considered as the root cause of the other six of
       the seven cardinal sins.

       The  seven  heavenly virtues: prudence, justice, tem-
       perance, courage, faith, hope and charity.

       used Zettelkasten, or slip box, to organise his ideas
       and  boost  his  productivity.  Discover how to apply
       ...

       Like vinyl records  and  hardcover  books,  Luhmann's
       original system was analog.  It consisted of numbered
       index cards, or slips, filed in six  large  cabinets.
       Each  slip  contained  a  single and complete idea, a
       concept his followers call 'atomicity' ...

       Sometimes, what seems  like  relaxation  is  actually
       work.   For instance, choosing chess over games as it
       has utility makes it less relaxing.  Headaches  vary,
       so it's personal.

       Here  is  a  simple  example that is plain to you yet
       eluded me until now.  Can you share other such  seem-
       ingly  obvious  things  other  miss, or ones you have
       overlooked while others find them self-evident?  I am
       eager to know.

A MEMORY
       This brings to mind a university English class  where
       our  teacher  asked for English reads recommendation.
       I proposed to the Bible, and the  teaching  assistant
       asked me how one should read Bible.

       Back then, I was surprised by that question.  I found
       it odd, thinking 'Just simply  read  it!'   But  now,
       having  dipped  into parts that piqued my interest, I
       now recognise the significance of that query.  I have
       realised  that  reading  whole  books, not fragments,
       safeguards me from missing out on any detail.

       query: ['kwire], a question, especially one addressed
       to an official or organisation

       pique:  [peek], verb, stimulate - interest or curios-
       ity.  E.g. 'you have piqued my curiousity  about  the
       man'

       odd:  [ah-d]  adjective: different from what is usual
       or expected; strange.

Abstract

   This blog is being migrated from the original groff(7) format to the
   new RFC format.  RFC's table of contents and the page-break
   functionality are expected to enhance the blog's overall readability
   and presentation.

   I don't put much time on it every day since this is just a hobby.  So
   the migration would take quite a long time.

1.  Introduction

   Introductory text

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Body

   Body text

2.1.  Focus

   Yes, we got to focus.

   We ask ourselves: does it harm when we listen to radio/music while
   working?

   Let's then ask ourselves: sometimes we hear interesting parts in
   radio/music.  At that point, don't we feel that we *try* to listen to
   it?  Yes, we paied our attention.

   But hey - does it harm?  Yes. Absolutely.  As we pay our attention
   elsewhere, we pay less attention on less work.  Which means it equals
   to spending less time at work.  Wow, that's bad.

   It makes the work time less measurable.  We can't get an exact 'full-
   work' time, but full of interruptions.  We don't know whether those
   interruptions are in great number or tiny.

   Actually, it *can* be in great number, just like how we have tried
   chatting in the same time as working.

2.2.  Interpretation Lanuages

   Just feel how good interpretation/scripting languages are when I
   built Node.JS for several hours yesterday night.

   Yes, I've got an old CPU.  But that still suggests something.  And
   even for newer CPU, there would be more complex projects.

2.3.  Quotes

   <CODE BEGINS> file "hunting"

   I always will remember --               I was in no mood to trifle;
   'Twas a year ago November --            I got down my trusty rifle
   I went out to shoot some deer           And went out to stalk my prey --
   On a morning bright and clear.          What a haul I made that day!
   I went and shot the maximum             I tied them to my bumper and
   The game laws would allow:              I drove them home somehow,
   Two game wardens, seven hunters,        Two game wardens, seven hunters,
   And a cow.                              And a cow.

   The Law was very firm, it               People ask me how I do it
   Took away my permit--                   And I say, "There's nothin' to it!
   The worst punishment I ever endured.    You just stand there lookin' cute,
   It turns out there was a reason:        And when something moves, you shoot."
   Cows were out of season, and            And there's ten stuffed heads
   One of the hunters wasn't insured.      In my trophy room right now:
                                           Two game wardens, seven hunters,
                                           And a pure-bred gurnsey cow.

   Like carved into mind.  They *just* simply don't do those things.
