I would use static method. Build static Jekyll site locally, then push
the built HTML/CSS/JS etc. files to the repo. The reason is that GitHub
Action might be problematic - e.g. when the GitHub server gets down ...

On the other side, the cons is that I would need to track the diff-s of
the *generated* HTML/CSS/JS etc. file. Absolutely more work than using
GitHub Action, which hides the generated site files behind the scene.
