ON BLOGGING
       We  have  decided  to  begin  our new blog on GitHub Pages. But why not
       other blogging platforms? What are the pros of GitHub Pages?

       The biggest pros should be the ability to  blog  on  the  command-line.
       GitHub  Pages is *designed* to be used on the command-line, while other
       blogging platforms are usually not. Other  blogging  platforms  usually
       provides browser interface. Although we might end up being able to blog
       on command-line with some scripting or something else, there  might  be
       issues, and why not simply use GitHub Pages?

       Another  unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version control thing. I
       don't really need version control, but it's okay for me. I feel  a  bit
       uneasy  for  the need of git-commit every time changes are made, but at
       the same time I always check what I have edited with git-diff.  This is
       weird.

       Availability  is another factor to be considered. Besides GitHub Pages,
       I know two other blog platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If  my  memory
       is correct, Blogspot is a Google thing, and is thus - like other Google
       thing - unavailable in the place I live in. I  cannot  connect  to  the
       Wordpress  website  either.  GitHub Pages is also unusable from time to
       time, but is at least available *some times*, and the repository  push-
       pull are not blocked and always available, according to my experience.


   Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?
       GitHub  is  mainly  designed to host code repositories, so I decided to
       check twice whether we could blog in GitHub Pages.

       In the document Quickstart for GitHub Pages, we found the answer:

             You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects,
             host a blog, or even share your resume.

       Yes, we could use GitHub Pages as blog. That is great - especially con-
       sidering  the  fact that for some reason - probably due to the national
       firewall - I could not connect to neither Blogspot nor Wordpress.

       Link to the document:

             https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart


   Plain-text blogging?
       Maybe we could blog in plaintext only? - that is, providing pages as  a
       big `pre` HTML tag.

       No.  This might be okay for users who prefer plain text like me, but it
       would probably look extremely weird for most people. People would  feel
       that maybe it's something wrong with my blog page, since it 'looks dif-
       ferent from other websites/blogs'.

       I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have used Jekyll for one of my  pre-
       vious  blogs, and it's good enough - there is space for improvement for
       everything, though.

       Wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with


   Reasons to Blog
       But why should we write blogs?

       Firstly, for fun.

       Secondly, blogging could help people know and understand us better, and
       might at the same time provide us with more opportunites and/or trust.

       What's  more,  I  myself have benefited a lot from the blogs written by
       other people - from the beginning - when I firstly studied DOS commands
       and  C coding. By writing blogs myself, maybe I would help other people
       - that's great, isn't it? Helping other people should be great.

       Also: practice English writing. We often talk about 'practice writing',
       but I found that the important part is editing. Editing. Many edits.

       I  write  in  English, so I could practice English writing. But I guess
       it's not very much about the language. Writing might  be  a  universal,
       language-independent  skill, which does not confine to one certain lan-
       guage.

       It occured to me that when I wrote blogs before, I don't  know  how  to
       manage the size of one article. The result is that, I wrote lots of re-
       ally tiny 'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'? - no,

       What I also did before is to edit Markdown texts  in-line  -  in  every
       line - which produces git-diff results that are more difficult to read.
       This time I find it great to minimise the  git-diff  results  -  since,
       anyway,  the  target  view  would  be the brew'd HTML, not the Markdown
       source text.


   Jekyll
       The posts are put in the `_posts` directory. They  would  automatically
       update  if we use `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-
       regenerates the site when a file is updated.

       `--livereload` is a really convenient feature which tells  the  browser
       to  refresh  the page every time we have made an edit. With this option
       specified, we won't need to refresh the page ourselves.

       Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the  following
       format:

             `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

       Where  `YEAR`  is  a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-
       digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the for-
       mat used in the file.

       It  would  be  easier to just grab a existing source and take a look at
       the format.

       Code snippets syntax:

             {% highlight ruby %}
             def print_hi(name)
                puts "Hi, #{name}"
             end
             print_hi('Tom')
             #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
             {% endhighlight %}

PLAIN-TEXT
       TAOUP
       useplaintext.email
       typewriter tradition

       Underline? Italic? Bold? No, I won't use these in my blog.  The  reason
       is  that  I want my blog to be able to be viewed in multiple plain-text
       environment. The GitHub in-browser source-view doesn't have support  to
       underline/italic/bold.  What's  more,  I  guess  some people have those
       turned off in their terminals. And what's more maybe  some  people  are
       still using dumb terminals?

       The  e-mail  environment  is also taken into consideration. Usually the
       plain-text email doesn't include underline/italic/bold.

RADIO
       I love radio. This might sound weird, as today we have Internet, but  I
       would  say  that  radio  has its advantage - analog signal. I feel that
       analog signal carries a sound of higher-quality than digital  signal  -
       at  least,  a  different  feeling. What's more, analog signal is really
       good for live/stream, since that even if there are distractions,  sound
       transmitted  with  analog  signal would still preserve some of its con-
       tents, while in the case of the  digital  signal  packet  loss  usually
       leads to simply vanity.

       Sometimes,  while I am doing other thing, I come up with the feeling of
       turning on the radio. Then I do. But very soon later, I feel distracted
       by  the  radio,  and  then feel like turning off the radio. It's like a
       loop. I don't feel good about this. My current solution is  simply  not
       to  turn  on the radio in the very beginning - since I would, according
       to experience, feel like turning it off in the end.

INTERPRETED/SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
       Interpreted/scripting  languages  are  good in the way that there is no
       compilation - and therefore, no compile-time errors! Wow. Only run-time
       errors.

       What's  more,  there are no extra generated files to worry about.  Just
       the source files.


GROFF
       At first this blog is written directly in  HTML.  After  some  edits  I
       found it really tiring to redo the typesetting whenever I make some ed-
       its - the line lengths would change, so if I am to  edit  one  line,  I
       would  in  the end edit multiple lines to adjust the typesetting, some-
       times even the whole paragraph. So I turned to groff(1), and  it  works
       great!

       The roff(7) text formatting language syntax is really clear and easy to
       use.   I  just  grab  a  roff  file  from  /usr/share/man/  -  it   was
       /usr/share/man/man1/bzip2.1  -  and I got my hands on. There are really
       not much commands, just SS, SH and TH for the title stuff.

       The only problem is that groff(1) generates output for the terminal, so
       I need to sed(1) out the terminal escape sequences.

       Now  I just need to edit the roff(7) source and `make`. The output HTML
       is also maintained by git(1), and it's really pleasant seeing the  git-
       diff updates automatically generated by groff(1). It beautiful.  Clear,
       neat and beautiful. And it doesn't hurt anything - if I  were  to  con-
       tinue editing the HTML by hand as before, that would be the same scene,
       with the only difference that the git-diff updates are  typeset  by  my
       hands, instead of automatically by groff(1).
