On Blogging
2025-05-02

We have decided to begin our new blog on GitHub Pages. But why not other
blogging platforms? What are the pros of GitHub Pages?

The biggest pros should be the ability to blog on the command-line. GitHub
Pages is *designed* to be used on the command-line, while other blogging
platforms are usually not. Other blogging platforms usually provides browser
interface. Although we might end up being able to blog on command-line with
some scripting or something else, there might be issues, and why not simply use
GitHub Pages?

Another unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version control thing. I don't
really need version control,
but it's okay for me.
I feel a bit uneasy for the need of git-commit every time changes are made,
but at the same time I always check what I have edited with git-diff.
This is weird.

Availability is another factor to be considered. Besides GitHub Pages,
I know two other blog platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If my memory
is correct, Blogspot is a Google thing, and is thus - like other Google
thing - unavailable in the place I live in. I cannot connect to the
Wordpress website either. GitHub Pages is also unusable from time to time,
but is at least available *some times*, and the repository push-pull
are not blocked and always available, according to my experience.

## Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?

GitHub is mainly designed to host code repositories, so I decided to
check twice whether we could blog in GitHub Pages.
In the document Quickstart for GitHub Pages, we have the answer:

> You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects,
> host a blog, or even share your resume.

Yes, we could use GitHub Pages as blog. That is great - especially
considering the fact that for some reason - probably due to
the national firewall -
I could not connect to neither Blogspot and Wordpress.

## Plaintext blogging

Maybe we could blog in plaintext only? - that is, providing pages as a big
`<pre>`.

No. This might be okay for users who prefer plain text like me,
but it would probably look
extremely weird for most people. People would feel that maybe it's something
wrong with my blog page, since it 'looks different from other websites/blogs'.

I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have used Jekyll for one of my previous
blogs, and it's good enough - there is space for improvement for everything,
though.

But wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with

TAOUP
useplaintext.email
typewriter tradition
underline
italic? bold?

80x24 'ANSI' screen?

## Reasons to blog

But why should we write blogs?
Firstly,
for fun.
Secondly,
blogs could help people know and understand me better,
 and might
at the same time provide me with more opportunites and/or trust. What's more,
I myself have benefited a lot from the blogs written by other people - for
many years, from the beginning - when I firstly studied DOS commands and coding
in C.
By writing blogs myself, maybe I would help then other people - that's great,
isn't it? Helping other people should be great.

Also: practice English writing. We often talk about 'practice writing',
but I found that the important part is editing. Editing. Many edits.

I write in English, so I could practice English writing. But I guess it's
not very much about the language. Writing might be a 'universal' skill, which
does not confine to one certain language.

It occured to me that when I wrote blogs before, I don't know how to
manage the size of one article. The result is that, I wrote lots of really
tiny 'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'? - no, 'snippet'
is even longer - maybe 'cards'
should be the right word.

What I also did before is to edit Markdown texts in-line - in every line -
which produces git-diff results that are more difficult to read. This time
I find it great to minimise the git-diff results - since, anyway, the
target view would be the brew'd HTML, not the Markdown source text.

The posts are put in the `_posts` directory.
They would automatically update if we use 
`jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates the site 
when a file is updated.

`--livereload` is a really convenient feature which tells the browser to
refresh the page every time we have made an edit. With this
option specified, we won't need to
refresh the page ourselves.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number,
 `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers,
 and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
 After that, include the necessary front matter.
It would be easier to just grab a existing source and take a look at the
format.

Code snippets syntax test:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
