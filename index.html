Greetings! I am delighted to welcome you to my home page, a digital space
where I share my thoughts, stories, and passions.

Here, you will discover my blog content, or perhaps it's more accurate to call
it a collection of drafts. These are the works in progress, the ideas still
taking shape on the page.

I am not good at writing, but I am eager to enhance my abilities through con-
sistent writing and editing.  I will constantly review and revise the content
I create, since I could always discover areas that need improvement several
minutes/hours/days/months/years after my previous edit.

Often, I realise that a different word would better suit a particular context,
offering greater precision or simply being a more fitting choice. There are
times when I identify redundant words that should be removed, or I spot typos
and other errors.

For instance, I have mistakenly typed case, I incorrectly used 'it' to refer
to the plural 'blogs' - when 'they' would have been the appropriate pronoun.
These examples illustrate that I frequently make writing errors, which is pre-
cisely why I am committed to this process of continuous refinement.

Therefore, please don't hesitate to share your advice with me.  I am always
eager to heard your thoughts and suggestions and learn from you.  You can
reach out to me via e-mail at the following address:

     huihang.yan@outlook.com

You can also sending pull requests via GitHub. I would be glad if my GitHub
repo page gets crowded. This page is hosted on GitHub Pages. Its corresponding
GitHub repository is public, so you can file issues and/or pull requests.

Edit history is kept in the GitHub repository commits.  If you are curious
what edits are made, you could check them out at the repo page.


DRAFT QUALITY
       I write blogs mostly for fun and to the hope that they might help other
       people in some way - at least they could be used as English-as-second-
       language usage corpus for linguistics study.  That is, I do not take
       this really serious. I need to do other things to survive in this
       world. As a result these blog articles might be of really low quality,
       before they get edited and/or updated days/weeks/months/years later af-
       ter they are published here at the first place.

       In other way, all stuff I put here shall be considered drafts.  Of
       draft quality, or we could say. But I believe that as time goes by they
       would get better and better with edits and/or updates.

       I remember a saying that a good work does not come out at once, but in-
       stead comes out with lots of edits. I remember that it is from Heming-
       way.  I asked an AI for confirmation, and the AI told me some relevant
       Hemingway quotes:

            1. 'The only kind of writing is rewriting.'

            2. 'All first drafts are shit.'

            3. Modify the works, 'removing the bullshit'.

       That AI also told me that:

            For example, he spent five months revising A Farewell to Arms
            after finishing the first darft in six months, and even made
            thirty nine revisions to the last page.

       I haven't further verify those things suggested by AI but they sound
       real and I think I have heard of them before.

       Anyway, what I mean is - draft quality. Draft quality.


END OF FRONTMATTER
       Here comes the end of the preface stuff.  Thanks for reading. The fol-
       lowing are blog articles - or should we say, again, drafts. Drafts.


ON BLOGGING
       I have decided to begin my new blog on GitHub Pages. But why GitHub
       Pages ? Why not other blogging platforms? What are the pros of GitHub
       Pages?

       The biggest pros should be the ability to blog on the command-line.
       GitHub Pages is *designed* to be used on the command-line, while other
       blogging platforms are usually not. Other blogging platforms usually
       provides browser interface. Although we might end up being able to blog
       on command-line with some scripting or something else, there might be
       issues, and why not simply use GitHub Pages?

       Another unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version control thing. I
       don't really need version control, but it's okay for me. I feel a bit
       uneasy for the need of git-commit every time changes are made, but at
       the same time I always check what I have edited with git-diff.  This is
       weird.

       Availability is another factor to be considered. Besides GitHub Pages,
       I know two other blog platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If my memory
       is correct, Blogspot is a Google thing, and is thus - like other Google
       thing - unavailable in the place I live in. I cannot connect to the
       Wordpress website either. GitHub Pages is also unusable from time to
       time, but is at least available *some times*, and the repository push-
       pull are not blocked and always available, according to my experience.


Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?
       GitHub is mainly designed to host code repositories, so I decided to
       check twice whether we could blog in GitHub Pages.

       Answer:

             You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects,
             host a blog, or even share your resume.

             -- Quickstart for GitHub Pages
                https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

       Yes, we could use GitHub Pages as blog. That is great - especially con-
       sidering the fact that for some reason - probably due to the national
       firewall - I could not connect to neither Blogspot nor Wordpress.



Plain-text blogging?
       Maybe we could blog in plaintext only? - that is, providing pages as a
       big `pre` HTML tag.

       No. This might be okay for users who prefer plain text like me, but it
       would probably look extremely weird for most people. People would feel
       that maybe it's something wrong with my blog page, since it 'looks dif-
       ferent from other websites/blogs'.

       I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have used Jekyll for one of my pre-
       vious blogs, and it's good enough - there is space for improvement for
       everything, though.

       Wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with


Reasons to Blog
       But why should we write blogs? There are several compelling reasons.

       Firstly, for fun. Blogging offers a source of enjoyment. It provides an
       outlet for self-expression, allowing us to explore our creativity,
       share our passions, and engage with topics that bring us joy. Whether
       it's writing about our hobbies, travel experiences, or personal mus-
       ings, the process of crafting a blog post can be a fulfilling and en-
       tertaining activity in itself.

       Secondly, blogging serves as a powerful means of communication. By
       sharing our thoughts, ideas and experiences, we give others a window
       into our world, enabling them to know and understand us on a deeper
       level. This increased transparency can foster stronger connections with
       our readers, build trust, and open new opportunites. It could lead to
       professional collaborations, new friendships, or a wider network of
       like-minded individuals who share our interests and values.

       What's more, I myself have benefited a lot from the blogs written by
       other people - from the beginning - when I firstly studied DOS commands
       and C coding. By writing blogs myself, maybe I would help other people
       - that's great, isn't it? Helping other people should be great.

       Also: practice English writing. We often talk about 'practice writing',
       but I found that the important part is editing. Editing. Many edits.

       I write in English, so I could practice English writing. But I guess
       it's not very much about the language. Writing might be a universal,
       language-independent skill, which does not confine to one certain lan-
       guage.

       It occured to me that when I wrote blogs before, I don't know how to
       manage the size of one article. The result is that, I wrote lots of re-
       ally tiny 'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'? - no,

       What I also did before is to edit Markdown texts in-line - in every
       line - which produces git-diff results that are more difficult to read.
       This time I find it great to minimise the git-diff results - since,
       anyway, the target view would be the brew'd HTML, not the Markdown
       source text.


Jekyll
       The posts are put in the `_posts` directory. They would automatically
       update if we use `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-
       regenerates the site when a file is updated.

       `--livereload` is a really convenient feature which tells the browser
       to refresh the page every time we have made an edit. With this option
       specified, we won't need to refresh the page ourselves.

       Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following
       format:

             `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

       Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-
       digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the for-
       mat used in the file.

       It would be easier to just grab a existing source and take a look at
       the format.

       Code snippets syntax:

             {% highlight ruby %}
             def print_hi(name)
                puts "Hi, #{name}"
             end
             print_hi('Tom')
             #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
             {% endhighlight %}

PLAIN-TEXT
       Some reasons to use plain-text can be found in the book TAOUP - The Art
       of Unix Programming, as well as the use-plain-text-email website:

             useplaintext.email

       The use-plain-text-email site gives some really interesting points, but
       those points are mainly for the context of e-mail:

       1. 72-column text for easier quoting.

       2. Phishing, marketing and spam e-mails use HTML. Plain-text emails can
       be distinguished between them.

       3. HTML is a giant standard that introduces many vulnerabilities in the
       implementation. What's more, those millions of features are unnecessary
       for the task of e-mail.

       4. HTML e-mail can contain hidden tracking stuff.

       5. HTML is less accessible, unless accessible is considered when writ-
       ing.

       6. Some people use e-mail clients that support *only* plain-text e-
       mails.

       But I think there is one important reason behind. The typewriter tradi-
       tion of the western society.


PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING
       The term plain-text is somewhat chaotic.

       At the very beginning there are the typewriters, which usually only
       prints out mono-colour letters and symbols. Typewriters support cursor
       movement, and therefore allowing using the underscore and hyphen sym-
       bols to print out underline and delete lines.

       In today's software terminal emulator, we could see underline, but
       delete lines are not the same widely supported. Many of the terminal
       emulators follow the 'standard' of VT-100, supporting a number of
       colour, bold and italic besides underline. As a result, the man pages
       make heavy use of underline and bold text widely and many distributions
       turn on the colour of the ls(1) program by default, along with a large
       number of various command-line software. An interesting thing is there
       are even people suggesting yet another new standard that supresses the
       colour output according to the NO_COLOR environment variable. See these
       two links:

               no-color.org
               github.com/jcs/no_color

       I typeset my blog page with groff(1), the same tool which processes the
       man-pages(7). Should I use underline and bold text just like man-
       pages(7) do? What about italic? No, I won't use these in my blog. The
       reason is that I want my blog to be able to be viewed in multiple
       plain-text environment. The GitHub in-browser source-view doesn't have
       support to underline/italic/bold. What's more, I guess some people have
       those turned off in their terminals. And what's more maybe some people
       are still using dumb terminals?

       The e-mail environment is also taken into consideration. Usually the
       plain-text email doesn't include underline/italic/bold.

RADIO
       I love radio. This might sound weird, as today we have Internet, but I
       would say that radio has its advantage - analog signal. I feel that
       analog signal carries a sound of higher-quality than digital signal -
       at least, a different feeling. What's more, analog signal is really
       good for live/stream, since that even if there are distractions, sound
       transmitted with analog signal would still preserve some of its con-
       tents, while in the case of the digital signal packet loss usually
       leads to simply vanity.

       Sometimes, while I am doing other thing, I come up with the feeling of
       turning on the radio. Then I do. But very soon later, I feel distracted
       by the radio, and then feel like turning off the radio. It's like a
       loop. I don't feel good about this. My current solution is simply not
       to turn on the radio in the very beginning - since I would, according
       to experience, feel like turning it off in the end.

       in the age bracket of 25 to 35 years, but we could not get them to stop
       laughing long enough to reach a decision.  Should the taste of the
       American woman ever change so drastically that bodies such as yours

       Friends, n:
       1. People who borrow your books and set wet glasses on them.
       2. People who know you well, but like you anyway.

       Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub-systems and so on ad
       infinitum -- which is why we're always starting over.

       Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels
       start closing in, the only cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and
       then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas ... with the mu-
       sic at top volume and at least a pint of ether.
                 -- H. S. Thompson, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"


       T:   One big monster, he called TROLL.
            He don't rock, and he don't roll;
            Drink no wine, and smoke no stogies.
            He just Love To Eat Them Roguies.

       SYSTEM-INDEPENDENT:
            Works equally poorly on all systems.


       Systems programmer:
            A person in sandals who has been in the elevator with the senior
            vice president and is ultimately responsible for a phone call you
            are to receive from your boss.

       Systems programmers are the high priests of a low cult.

INTERPRETED/SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
       Interpreted/scripting languages are good in the way that there is no
       compilation - and therefore, no compile-time errors! Wow. Only run-time
       errors.

       What's more, there are no extra generated files to worry about.  Just
       the source files.



ROFF(7)/GROFF(1)/TROFF?
       At first this blog is written directly in HTML. After some edits I
       found it really tiring to redo the typesetting whenever I make some ed-
       its - the line lengths would change, so if I am to edit one line, I
       would in the end edit multiple lines to adjust the typesetting, some-
       times even the whole paragraph. So I turned to groff(1), and it works
       great!

       The roff(7) text formatting language syntax is really clear and easy to
       use.  I just grab a roff file from /usr/share/man/ - it was
       /usr/share/man/man1/bzip2.1 - and I got my hands on. There are really
       not much commands, just SS, SH and TH for the title stuff.

       The only problem is that groff(1) generates output for the terminal, so
       I need to sed(1) out the terminal escape sequences.

       Now I just need to edit the roff(7) source and `make`. The output HTML
       is also maintained by git(1), and it's really pleasant seeing the git-
       diff updates automatically generated by groff(1). It beautiful.  Clear,
       neat and beautiful. And it doesn't hurt anything - if I were to con-
       tinue editing the HTML by hand as before, that would be the same scene,
       with the only difference that the git-diff updates are typeset by my
       hands, instead of automatically by groff(1).

       groff(7) randomly resets the typesetting even for paragraphs that I
       haven't touched. An AI told me that I can use the '.na' command to dis-
       able justification in order to fix this. Let's see if it works ...
