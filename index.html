1.  ON BLOGGING

   We have decided to begin our new blog on GitHub Pages. But why not other
   blogging platforms? What are the pros of GitHub Pages?

   The biggest pros should be the ability to blog on the command-line. GitHub
   Pages is *designed* to be used on the command-line, while other blogging
   platforms are usually not. Other blogging platforms usually provides
   browser interface. Although we might end up being able to blog on
   command-line with some scripting or something else, there might be issues,
   and why not simply use GitHub Pages?

   Another unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version control thing. I
   don't really need version control, but it's okay for me. I feel a bit
   uneasy for the need of git-commit every time changes are made,
   but at the same time I always check what I have edited with git-diff.
   This is weird.

   Availability is another factor to be considered. Besides GitHub Pages,
   I know two other blog platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If my memory
   is correct, Blogspot is a Google thing, and is thus - like other Google
   thing - unavailable in the place I live in. I cannot connect to the
   Wordpress website either. GitHub Pages is also unusable from time to time,
   but is at least available *some times*, and the repository push-pull
   are not blocked and always available, according to my experience.

1.1.  Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?

   GitHub is mainly designed to host code repositories, so I decided to
   check twice whether we could blog in GitHub Pages.
      
   In the document Quickstart for GitHub Pages, we found the answer:
      
      You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects,
      host a blog, or even share your resume.

   Yes, we could use GitHub Pages as blog. That is great - especially
   considering the fact that for some reason - probably due to the
   national firewall - I could not connect to neither Blogspot nor
   Wordpress.

1.2.  Plain-text blogging?

   Maybe we could blog in plaintext only? - that is, providing pages
   as a big `pre` HTML tag.

   No. This might be okay for users who prefer plain text like me,
   but it would probably look extremely weird for most people. People
   would feel that maybe it's something wrong with my blog page,
   since it 'looks different from other websites/blogs'.

   I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have used Jekyll for one of my
   previous blogs, and it's good enough - there is space for
   improvement for everything, though.

   Wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with

1.3.  Reasons to Blog

   But why should we write blogs?

   Firstly, for fun.

   Secondly, blogging could help people know and understand us better,
   and might at the same time provide us with more opportunites and/or
   trust.

   What's more, I myself have benefited a lot from the blogs written
   by other people - from the beginning - when I firstly studied DOS
   commands and C coding. By writing blogs myself, maybe I would help
   other people - that's great, isn't it? Helping other people should
   be great.

   Also: practice English writing. We often talk about 'practice writing',
but I found that the important part is editing. Editing. Many edits.

I write in English, so I could practice English writing. But I guess it's
not very much about the language. Writing might be a 'universal' skill, which
does not confine to one certain language.

It occured to me that when I wrote blogs before, I don't know how to
manage the size of one article. The result is that, I wrote lots of really
tiny 'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'? - no, 'snippet'
is even longer - maybe 'cards'
should be the right word.

What I also did before is to edit Markdown texts in-line - in every line -
which produces git-diff results that are more difficult to read. This time
I find it great to minimise the git-diff results - since, anyway, the
target view would be the brew'd HTML, not the Markdown source text.

The posts are put in the `_posts` directory.
They would automatically update if we use 
`jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates the site 
when a file is updated.

`--livereload` is a really convenient feature which tells the browser to
refresh the page every time we have made an edit. With this
option specified, we won't need to
refresh the page ourselves.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number,
 `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers,
 and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
 After that, include the necessary front matter.
It would be easier to just grab a existing source and take a look at the
format.

Code snippets syntax test:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

   italic? bold?

2.  RADIO

   I love radio. This might sound weird, as today we have Internet, but
   I would say that radio has its advantage - analog signal. I feel that
   analog signal carries a sound of higher-quality than digital signal
   - at least, a different feeling. What's more, analog signal is really
   good for live/stream, since that even if there are distractions,
   sound transmitted with analog signal would still preserve some of its
   contents, while in the case of the digital signal packet loss usually
   leads to simply vanity.

   Sometimes, while I am doing other thing, I come up with the feeling of 
   turning on the radio. Then I do. But very soon later, I feel distracted
   by the radio, and then feel like turning off the radio. It's like a
   loop. I don't feel good about this. My current solution is simply not
   to turn on the radio in the very beginning - since I would, according to
   experience, feel like turning it off in the end.

ALASKA:
