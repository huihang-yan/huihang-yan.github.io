WELCOME
       Welcome  to  my  greenhouse/home page: a drafty space
       for thoughts, stories, passions.

       Yes, drafts - work in  progress.   Please  understand
       the quality.  Grateful for suggestions.

       Here,  you  will discover my blog content, or perhaps
       it's more accurate to call it a collection of drafts.
       These  are  the  works  in  progress, the ideas still
       taking shape on the page.

       Not a good writer, but eager to improve.   Will  keep
       writing,  editing, reviewing, and revising - there is
       always room for improvement.  Always find  areas  for
       improvement,  from  minutes,  hours,  days, months to
       years post-edit.

       Often, I realise that a different word  would  better
       suit a particular context, offering greater precision
       or simply being a  more  fitting  choice.  There  are
       times  when I identify redundant words that should be
       removed, or I spot typos and other errors.

       For  instance,  I  have  mistakenly  typed  case,   I
       incorrectly  used 'it' to refer to the plural 'blogs'
       -  when  'they'  would  have  been  the   appropriate
       pronoun.  These examples illustrate that I frequently
       make writing errors, which  is  precisely  why  I  am
       committed to this process of continuous refinement.

       Therefore, please don't hesitate to share your advice
       with me.  I am always eager to  heard  your  thoughts
       and  suggestions  and  learn from you.  You can reach
       out to me via e-mail at the following address:

              huihang.yan@outlook.com

       You can also send pull requests via GitHub.  I  would
       be  glad  if  my GitHub repo page gets crowded.  This
       page is hosted on GitHub  Pages.   Its  corresponding
       GitHub  repository  is public, so you can file issues
       and/or pull requests.

       Edit  history  is  kept  in  the  GitHub   repository
       commits.  If you are curious what edits are made, you
       could check them out at the repo page.

DRAFT QUALITY
       I write blogs mostly for fun and  to  the  hope  that
       they  might  help other people in some way - at least
       they  could  be  used  as  English-as-second-language
       usage  corpus  for  linguistics study.  That is, I do
       not take this really serious.  I  need  to  do  other
       things  to  survive  in this world. As a result these
       blog articles might be of really low quality,  before
       they       get       edited       and/or      updated
       days/weeks/months/years   later   after   they    are
       published here at the first place.

       In   other  way,  all  stuff  I  put  here  shall  be
       considered drafts.  Of draft  quality,  or  we  could
       say.  But  I  believe that as time goes by they would
       get better and better with edits and/or updates.

       I remember a saying that a good work  does  not  come
       out  at  once,  but  instead  comes  out with lots of
       edits. I remember that it is from Hemingway.  I asked
       an  AI  for  confirmation,  and  the  AI told me some
       relevant Hemingway quotes.

       The first one  is:  'The  only  kind  of  writing  is
       rewriting.'

       The second one is: 'All first drafts are shit.'

       The  third  one  is:  Modify the works, 'removing the
       bullshit'.

       That AI also told me that:  'For  example,  he  spent
       five   months  revising  A  Farewell  to  Arms  after
       finishing the first draft in  six  months,  and  even
       made thirty nine revisions to the last page.'

       I haven't further verify those things suggested by AI
       but they sound real and I think I have heard of  them
       before.

       Anyway,  what  I  mean  is  -  draft  quality.  Draft
       quality.

END OF FRONTMATTER
       Here comes the end of the preface stuff.  Thanks  for
       reading.

       The  following  are blog articles - or should we say,
       again, drafts. Drafts.

ON BLOGGING
       I have decided to begin my new blog on GitHub  Pages.
       But  why  GitHub  Pages?  Why not opt for other well-
       known   blogging   platforms   instead?   And    most
       importantly,  what  are  the distinct advantages that
       GitHub Pages offers?

       The biggest pros should be the ability to blog on the
       command-line.   GitHub Pages is *designed* to be used
       on the command-line, while other  blogging  platforms
       are  usually  not.  Other  blogging platforms usually
       provides browser interface. Although we might end  up
       being   able   to  blog  on  command-line  with  some
       scripting or something else, there might  be  issues,
       and why not simply use GitHub Pages?

       Another unique feature of GitHub Pages is the version
       control thing. I don't really need  version  control,
       but  it's  okay  for  me. I feel a bit uneasy for the
       need of git-commit every time changes are  made,  but
       at  the  same  time I always check what I have edited
       with git-diff.  This is weird.

       Availability is  another  factor  to  be  considered.
       Besides   GitHub   Pages,   I  know  two  other  blog
       platforms, Blogspot and Wordpress. If  my  memory  is
       correct,  Blogspot  is  a Google thing, and is thus -
       like other Google thing - unavailable in the place  I
       live  in.  I  cannot connect to the Wordpress website
       either. GitHub Pages is also unusable  from  time  to
       time, but is at least available *some times*, and the
       repository  push-pull  are  not  blocked  and  always
       available, according to my experience.


Is it okay to blog on GitHub Pages?
       GitHub  is mainly designed to host code repositories,
       so I decided to check twice whether we could blog  in
       GitHub Pages.

       Answer:  'You  can  use GitHub Pages to showcase some
       open source projects, host a blog, or even share your
       resume.'  This  is mentioned in Quickstart for GitHub
       Pages:

              https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

       So yes, we could use GitHub Pages as  blog.  That  is
       great - especially considering the fact that for some
       reason - probably due to the national  firewall  -  I
       could not connect to neither Blogspot nor Wordpress.

PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING?
       Maybe  we  could  blog  in plaintext only? - that is,
       providing pages as a big `pre` HTML tag.

       No. This might be okay for  users  who  prefer  plain
       text  like  me,  but it would probably look extremely
       weird for most people. People would feel  that  maybe
       it's  something  wrong  with  my  blog page, since it
       'looks different from other websites/blogs'.

       I decided to use Jekyll for now. I have  used  Jekyll
       for  one of my previous blogs, and it's good enough -
       there  is  space  for  improvement  for   everything,
       though.

       Wait - we could probably fuse Jekyll with

REASONS TO BLOG
       But  why  should  we  write  blogs? There are several
       compelling reasons.

       Firstly,  for  fun.  Blogging  offers  a  source   of
       enjoyment. It provides an outlet for self-expression,
       allowing us to  explore  our  creativity,  share  our
       passions,  and  engage with topics that bring us joy.
       Whether  it's  writing  about  our  hobbies,   travel
       experiences,  or  personal  musings,  the  process of
       crafting  a  blog  post  can  be  a  fulfilling   and
       entertaining activity in itself.

       Secondly,  blogging  serves  as  a  powerful means of
       communication. By sharing  our  thoughts,  ideas  and
       experiences,  we give others a window into our world,
       enabling them to know and understand us on  a  deeper
       level.   This   increased   transparency  can  foster
       stronger connections with our readers,  build  trust,
       and   open   new   opportunites.  It  could  lead  to
       professional collaborations, new  friendships,  or  a
       wider  network  of  like-minded individuals who share
       our interests and values.

       What's more, I myself have benefited a lot  from  the
       blogs  written by other people - from the beginning -
       when I firstly studied DOS commands and C coding.  By
       writing blogs myself, maybe I would help other people
       - that's great, isn't it? Helping other people should
       be great.

       Also:  practice  English writing. We often talk about
       'practice writing', but I found  that  the  important
       part is editing. Editing. Many edits.

       I  write  in  English,  so  I  could practice English
       writing. But I guess it's not  very  much  about  the
       language.  Writing  might  be  a universal, language-
       independent skill, which  does  not  confine  to  one
       certain language.

       It  occured  to  me that when I wrote blogs before, I
       don't know how to manage the size of one article. The
       result   is   that,  I  wrote  lots  of  really  tiny
       'articles' - or, should we use the term 'snippet'?  -
       no,

       What  I also did before is to edit Markdown texts in-
       line -  in  every  line  -  which  produces  git-diff
       results  that are more difficult to read. This time I
       find it great to  minimise  the  git-diff  results  -
       since,  anyway,  the  target view would be the brew'd
       HTML, not the Markdown source text.

JEKYLL
       The posts are put in  the  `_posts`  directory.  They
       would  automatically update if we use `jekyll serve`,
       which launches a web server and auto-regenerates  the
       site when a file is updated.

       `--livereload`  is  a really convenient feature which
       tells the browser to refresh the page every  time  we
       have  made  an  edit.  With this option specified, we
       won't need to refresh the page ourselves.

       Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according
       to the following format:

              `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

       Where  `YEAR`  is  a  four-digit  number, `MONTH` and
       `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the
       file  extension  representing  the format used in the
       file.

       It would be easier to just grab a existing source and
       take a look at the format.

       Code snippets syntax in Jekyll:

              {% highlight ruby %}
              def print_hi(name)
                 puts "Hi, #{name}"
              end
              print_hi('Tom')
              #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
              {% endhighlight %}

PLAIN-TEXT
       Some reasons to use plain-text can be  found  in  the
       book  TAOUP - The Art of Unix Programming, as well as
       the use-plain-text-email website:

              useplaintext.email

       The use-plain-text-email site gives some  really  in-
       teresting points, but those points are mainly for the
       context of e-mail:

       1. 72-column text for easier quoting.

       2. Phishing, marketing and  spam  e-mails  use  HTML.
       Plain-text emails can be distinguished between them.

       3. HTML is an extensive standard, and its implementa-
       tion often gives rise to  numerours  vulnerabilities.
       What's more, the vast array of features that HTML en-
       compasses is largely superfluous when it comes to the
       purpose of email.

       4. HTML e-mail can contain hidden tracking stuff.

       5. HTML is less accessible, unless accessible is con-
       sidered when writing.

       6. Some people use e-mail clients that support *only*
       plain-text e-mails.

       But I think there is one important reason behind. The
       typewriter tradition of the western society.

PLAIN-TEXT BLOGGING
       The term plain-text is somewhat chaotic.

       At the very  beginning  there  are  the  typewriters,
       which usually only prints out mono-colour letters and
       symbols. Typewriters  support  cursor  movement,  and
       therefore  allowing  using  the underscore and hyphen
       symbols to print out underline and delete lines.

       Today's software terminal emulators  offer  underlin-
       ing,  but  strikethrough  is  not the same way widely
       supported. Many  terminal  emulators  adhere  to  the
       VT-100 'standard', which, in addition to underlining,
       offers support for  a  number  of  colour,  bold  and
       italic  formatting.   Consequently,  man  pages  make
       heavy use of underlined and bold text, and many  dis-
       tributions  enable  the  coloured output of the ls(1)
       program by default, along with  numerous  other  com-
       mand-line software.

       An intriguing development is that some people propose
       a yet another new standard that restricts colour out-
       put  based on the NO_COLOR environment variable. Take
       a look at these two links:

              no-color.org
              github.com/jcs/no_color

       I typeset my blog with groff(1), the very  same  tool
       employed for processing the man-pages(7). This choice
       then prompts a series of questions: Should I incorpo-
       rate  underlined and bold text, mirroring the format-
       ting  commonly  seen  in  man-pages(7)?   What  about
       italic?

       No, I won't use these in my blog.

       The  rational  behind this decision stems from my de-
       sire to ensure that my blog remains fully  accessible
       and  legible across a diverse range of plain-text en-
       vironments. For instance, the in-browser  source-view
       feature on GitHub lacks support to underlined, italic
       and bold text.

       Additionally, I suspect that some users may have dis-
       abled  such  formatting  options  in their terminals,
       perhaps due to personal preference.   Moreover,  it's
       entirely  possible  that  some people are still using
       'dumb terminals', which typically lacks  support  for
       advanced text formatting.

       By  avoiding these formatting elements, I aim to cre-
       ate a blog that can be seamlessly viewed  and  under-
       stood  by as wide an audience as possible, regardless
       of the specific viewing environment they use.

       The e-mail environment is also taken into  considera-
       tion.  Usually  the  plain-text email doesn't include
       underline/italic/bold.

RADIO
       I love radio. This might sound  weird,  as  today  we
       have Internet, but I would say that radio has its ad-
       vantage - analog signal. I feel  that  analog  signal
       carries a sound of higher-quality than digital signal
       - at least, a different feeling. What's more,  analog
       signal  is  really  good  for live/stream, since that
       even if there  are  distractions,  sound  transmitted
       with  analog  signal would still preserve some of its
       contents, while in the case  of  the  digital  signal
       packet loss usually leads to simply vanity.

       Sometimes,  while  I  am doing other thing, I come up
       with the feeling of turning on the radio. Then I  do.
       But  very soon later, I feel distracted by the radio,
       and then feel like turning off the radio. It's like a
       loop.  I don't feel good about this. My current solu-
       tion is simply not to turn on the radio in  the  very
       beginning  -  since I would, according to experience,
       feel like turning it off in the end.

QUOTES
       Here  are  quotes,  which  I believe are from ancient
       Chinese, and probably Confucius:

              1. Do not do to others what you  do  not  want
              others to do to you.

              2.  Turn  inward and examine yourself when you
              encounter difficulties in life.

              3. Repay kindness with kindness.

       Here are some other quotes:

              Do not confuse knowledge with  wisdom:  knowl-
              edge teachs you to earn a living, while wisdom
              ensures that life is worth living.

              Surround yourself with  those  who  appreciate
              your  unique  qualities,  not those who try to
              diminish them.

              Life shines brightly, and  every  creature  is
              delightful.

              A low-quality circle will do and say all sorts
              of things to destroy your ambition.

       Here `circle' stands for social circle  -  people  we
       talk/meet/have fun/hang out with etc.

       Alan  Turing  thought  about  criteria  to settle the

       question of whether submarines can swim.

       Albert Camus wrote that the only serious question  is
       whether  to  kill  yourself or not. Tom Robbins wrote
       that the only serious question is whether time has  a

       wrong side of bed, and Robbins must have forgotten to
       set the alarm.

       Dear Sir:
       Your  name  has been submitted to us with your photo.
       I regret to inform you that we will be unable to  use
       your  body  in  our centerfold.  On a scale of one to
       ten, your body was rated a minus two by  a  panel  of
       women  ranging  in age from 60 to 75 years.  We tried
       to assemble a panel in the age bracket of  25  to  35
       years,  but  we  could  not get them to stop laughing
       long enough to reach a decision.  Should the taste of
       the  American  woman  ever change so drastically that
       bodies such as yours would be appropriate in our mag-
       azine,  you will be notified by this office.  Please,
       don't call us.

       Sympathetically,
       Amanda L. Smith

       p.s. We also want to commend  you  for  your  unusual
       pose.   Were  you  wounded in the war, or do you ride
       your bike a lot?

INTERPRETED/SCRIPTING LANGUAGES
       Interpreted/scripting languages are good in  the  way
       that there is no compilation - and therefore, no com-
       pile-time errors!  Wow.  Only run-time errors.

       What's more, there are no extra  generated  files  to
       worry about.  Just the source files.

       The  problem  of  C/C++  is that they do not have the
       modern standard libraries.  They are born in the ages
       of  the  command-line interface, and when the network
       standards have not yet been settled.

       C/C++ have not standard library for GUI, network  and
       even  no curses-like terminal functionality.  All the
       things are file system and line-oriented I/O  -  that
       is, only ed(1), even not vi(1).

       At  that time C is a good save for portability.  How-
       ever it's not anymore true today.  The lack of  stan-
       dard libraries result in lack of portability.

       Imagine  when we develop a GUI program.  If we are to
       use a GUI toolkit,  then  the  portability  gets  re-
       stricted  by that GUI toolkit.  If we are to write it
       ourselves, people with other environment would  often
       find  our  program not working in their boxes, due to
       the system-dependent code.

       The good thing is  that  we  have  Qt,  GTK  and  web
       browsers, which provide a really full support to dif-
       ferent environments, and work as a good standard  li-
       brary  -  filling the gaps of the standard library of
       C/C++.

       Apart from giant  solutions  like  Qt,  GTK  and  web
       browsers,  it  is also popular to solve this issue by
       writing a HTTP server instead and let the user pick a
       browser to render the user interface. This is smart.

       However,  this  also  requires  a good cross-platform
       network library.  The good news is that a network li-
       brary is much smaller and there exist good ones.

ROFF(7)/GROFF(1)/TROFF?
       At  first this blog is written directly in HTML.  Af-
       ter some edits I found it really tiring to  redo  the
       typesetting  whenever  I  make  some edits - the line
       lengths would change, so if I am to edit one line,  I
       would  in  the  end edit multiple lines to adjust the
       typesetting, sometimes even the whole paragraph.   So
       I turned to groff(1), and it works great!

       The roff(7) text formatting language syntax is really
       clear and easy to use.  I just grab a roff file  from
       /usr/share/man/  - it was /usr/share/man/man1/bzip2.1
       - and I got my hands on.  There are really  not  much
       commands, just SS, SH and TH for the title stuff.

       The  only  problem  is that groff(1) generates output
       for the terminal, so I need to sed(1) out the  termi-
       nal escape sequences.

       Now  I  just  need  to  edit  the  roff(7) source and
       `make`.   The  output  HTML  is  also  maintained  by
       git(1),  and it's really pleasant seeing the git-diff
       updates automatically generated  by  groff(1).   It's
       beautiful.    Clear,  neat  and  beautiful.   And  it
       doesn't hurt anything - if I were to continue editing
       the  HTML  by  hand as before, that would be the same
       scene, with the only difference that the git-diff up-
       dates  are  typeset by my hands, instead of automati-
       cally by groff(1).

       groff(7) randomly resets  the  typesetting  even  for
       paragraphs  that  I  haven't  touched.  An AI told me
       that I can use the '.na' command to disable  justifi-
       cation  in  order to fix this.  Let's see if it works
       ...

THE ROFF FAMILY
       The family of the roff type-setting system:

       groff = GNU roff

       troff: the *roff language*  was  historically  called
       *troff*.

       Texinfo:  software  documentation  system that uses a
       single source file to produce both online information
       and printed output.

       nroff: use groff to format documents for TTY devices.

              GNU  _nroff_  emulates  the  traditional  Unix
              _nroff_ command using groff(1).  _nroff_  gen-
              erats output via grotty(1), _groff_'s TTY out-
              put device.

       troff.org: 'The Text Processor for Typesetters'

              'troff, and its  GNU  implementation  `groff`,
              are  programs  that process a textual descrip-
              tion of a document to produce typeset  verions
              suitable  for  printing.   It's more 'What you
              describe is what you get'  rather  than  WYSI-
              WYG.'

              'The  great  strength of `troff` is the flexi-
              bility of the  basic  language  and  its  pro-
              grammability - it can be made to do almost any
              formatting task.'
                     -- The UNIX Programming Environment,
                        Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike.

ROFF NOTES
       The roff language is line-oriented.  There  are  only
       two  kinds  of  lines,  control lines and text lines.
       The control lines start with a control character,  by
       default a period '.' or a single quote `'`; all other
       lines are text lines.

       Command arguments are separated by  spaces,  but  not
       tab characters.

       For  indentation,  any number of space or tab charac-
       ters can be  inserted  between  the  leading  control
       character and the command name, but the control char-
       acter must be on the first position of the line.

       Escape sequence - backslash `\'.

       '.P'

       '.I xxx' - italic

       '.' - a line consisting of  a  dot  only,  an  'empty
       roff(1) request':

            'To  additionally  use  the  auto-fill  mode  in
       Emacs, it is best to insert an empty roff(1) request,
       a  line  consisting  of  a  dot only, after each sen-
       tence.'

            Thus, this dot-line appears to serve solely  the
       purpose  of  activating  a  certain auto-fill feature
       within Emacs, and seems to hold no function in  terms
       of  typesetting,  much  like a comment line that does
       not contribute to the actual execution or  formatting
       of  the  content.  Since I don't use Emacs, it stands
       to reason that I can  safely  overlook  this  command
       without  any  adverse  effects on my tasks related to
       typesetting or otherwise.

       '.BR' - bold text?

       Macro definition: '.de [macro]',  then  use  '..'  to
       end.

       nop: '.nop [anything]' - always process [anything]

       macro stuff: \)\\$*

              \$*:  the concatenation of all arguments sepa-
              rated by spaces

       However, when `\$' appears alone, it stands as a sin-
       gle-character  escapes, resulting in a non-printable,
       zero-width glyph.

       This nature makes it suitable for the purpose of  be-
       ing  put at the start of a line to prevent the `real'
       beginning character to be parsed  as  commands.   For
       example,  when we really need to write something that
       begins with the dot, instead of trying  to  enter  an
       groff command.

       tab:  if  a tab character occurs during text, the in-
       terpreter makes a horizontal jump to the next pre-de-
       fined  tab position.  There is a sophisticated inter-
       face for handling tab positions.

       Tabbed/indent example code snippet:
              .RS
              .EX
              $ code here, automatically indented
              .EE
              .RE

       .RS: reduce space. Start a block  of  indented  text.
       Creates  a  new indentation level. `.RS n` to specify
       the indentation value.

       .EX: start an example block.

       .SS: subsection, like .SN, though .SS further indents
       - that's why its called _sub_section.

       List:
              .TP
              .B item1
              blah blah
              .TP

SPACING
       An  issue  has  been noticed when using Groff. It ap-
       pears that whenever there are alterations to a single
       line  within  a paragraph, even when subsequent para-
       graphs remain completely unchanged in terms of  their
       content, their spacing also gets modified.

       Despite  the text content in these paragraphs remain-
       ing the same, the visible layout of the  document  is
       affected.

       This  is  very  annoying  when it comes together with
       git-diff.  I am wondering if this is a well-known  or
       classical problem within in the Groff community.

       Well,  it seems so. Let's check the man-page.  In the
       section EDITING ROFF:

              All _roff_ formatters provide  automated  line
              breaks and horizontal and vertical spacing. In
              order to not disturb this, the following  tips
              can be helpful.

              First  of  all,  never  include empty or blank
              lines in a roff  document.  Instead,  use  the
              empty request, i.e. a line consisting of a dot
              only, or a line comment .\" if  a  structuring
              element is needed.

              Never  start  a  line  with whitespace because
              this can lead to  unexpected  behaviour.   In-
              dented paragraphs can be constructed in a con-
              trolled way by roff requests.

              Start each sentence on a line of its own,  for
              the spacing after a dot is handled differently
              depending on whether it terminates an abbrevi-
              ation  or  a  sentence.   To  distinguish both
              cases, do a line break  after  each  sentence.
              The  following  example shows a judicious line
              breaking in a roff input file.

                     This is an example of a
                     .I roff
                     document that you can type into your text editor.
                     .
                     This is the next sentence in the same paragraph.
                     .
                     This is a longer sentence stretching over several
                     input lines;
                     abbreviations like cf. are easily identified
                     because the dot is not followed by a
                     line break.
                     .
                     In the output, this sentence continues
                     the same paragraph.

       This might be the case.  There seems  to  have  three
       things which might cause problems.

       Firstly the blank lines.  It would 'disturb' the for-
       matting?

       Secondly the line starting with whitespace.  This can
       'lead  to  unexpected  behaviour'?  Well, weird.  Too
       weird.  Anyway, though it's weird, let's try not step
       on this trap.  It's not that hard.

       Finally,  start  each  sentence on a line of its own.
       'For the spacing after a dot is  handled  differently
       depending on whether it terminates an abbreviation or
       a sentence.'  Well, this is also weird.   But  anyway
       let's try to follow this security advice too.

SEMBR
       Semantic line breaks.  Yes, that's the term.

       I  remember  seeing  it  for Markdown stuff.  Haven't
       thought it would even really work in this case -  and
       as such an important role - in roff(7).

       See sembr.org.

              Semantic Line Breaks describe a set of conven-
              tions for using  insensitive  vertical  white-
              space to structure prose along semantic bound-
              aries.  Many lightweight markup languages, in-
              cluding Markdown, reStructured Text, and Asci-
              iDoc, join ...

       Also see:
              writingslowly.com/
                     semantic-line-breaks-are-a.html

              Semantic line breaks are a  feature  of  Mark-
              down, not a bug

              As  the semantic line break specification sug-
              gests, by inserting line  breaks  at  semantic
              boundaries,  writers,  editors, and other col-
              laborators can make source text easier to work
              with, without affecting how it's seen by read-
              ers.

A COMMENT
       A commenter claimed the Markdown  line-break  conven-
       tion  was  a  compromise to appease conflicting stan-
       dards.  They found  it  infuriating  -  obviously,  a
       Markdown line-break should equal a real one.

       They also hate the Markdown bold and italic text con-
       ventions.  To them, single asterisks should mark bold
       text, single underscores italic.  Simple as that.

       Well,  I  would like to say something about that com-
       ment.

       I understand why people feel weird that why don't  we
       simply  use 'real' newlines.  This is largely for the
       ease of line-based diff(1), which  is  used  in  git-
       diff,  patch(1) and various means to control the ver-
       sion and share edits.

       If we use 'real' newlines, every time we make a  tiny
       edit, we get a real mountainous number of diff(1) re-
       sult.

       This might sound a bit abstract. You  can  check  the
       commit history of some git-based GitHub Pages.

       Yes,  many  people  just  do not use version control,
       neither collobrate with others with  old-school  Unix
       tools  like diff(1) and patch(1).  But that's a large
       portion of the world of Markdown.  The world of Unix.

       In fact, I feel really nature about  this  line-break
       convention  -  that's  just how we do for everything.
       Roff(7), LaTeX, RST, HTML.  Yes, HTML - we can  check
       the  source of the HTML pages, and we could find that
       it's in the same line-breaking convention.   HTML  is
       designed  to  line  break the same way - why? Because
       that's just how we do all the time.  Lol.

       Check the plain text documents  provided  along  with
       the  Unix  world  stuff. 99% of them are written this
       way. Let's just grab two Slackware documents for  ex-
       ample.   If you want more, I could find really enough
       amount of them. Since they are just everywhere.   Ei-
       ther  LFS,  TLDP,  Python PEPs, Python RST documenta-
       tion, the Linux kernel documentation, RFC sources ...

              ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/
                  slackware64-15.0/
                      Slackware-HOWTO
                      usb-and-pxe-istallers/README_USB.TXT

       And I forgot the plain text emails - yes, just  check
       any  maillist,  either  ArchLinux, Debian, Slackware,
       Gentoo ...  Majority of the mails are line-broke this
       way.

       So  the result is - for people of certain background,
       this feels just natural. But for others,  this  might
       feel weird.

       It  might  help  with understand this thing with some
       historical matter. At first, the word-wrap feature is
       not  as  common  as  they  are in today - just grab a
       classic vi(1) or vim(1) editor, and  you  could  find
       that  the  word-wrap  feature is even disabled by de-
       fault.

       Since there are no common  word-wrap,  it  has  grown
       into  a  habit  and etiputte to wrap by hand - that's
       just we say, that new-line convention.  The  rational
       is  simple:  some  other people do not have word-wrap
       turned on in their editors, so it would look  a  mess
       if we don't.

       And for the asterik part, I shall say that underscore
       is for underline.

GACHA
THEN HOW?
       Ok, now we have learnt from the  possible  causes  to
       that space-modifing issue.  Then what should we do?

       The  only  issue should be how to separate paragraphs
       without using black lines.  I check the roff  sources
       of  the  man-pages, and I see them use '.P'.  I tried
       it and it works.

       Well, seems that we don't have problems anymore.  But
       what exactly is '.P'?

       I asked an AI and it told me that the '.P' command is
       used to start a new paragraph.

       The AI also told me that there is an '.LP' command to
       start  a  list paragraph, and might add bullet points
       and numbering.  That sounds good and useful.

       But where is '.P' command mentioned in the man-pages?
       Weird, can't find it.

KAKAOTALK
       The  registration  requires  the user to send an SMS,
       instead of receiving an SMS from them.

PROTON MAIL
       Proton Mail also comes with a VPN. The limit  of  the
       free plan is one connection.

       IMAP/SMTP:  included with Mail Plus, Proton Unlimited
       and Proton for Business.  Need to upgrade.

       That is, there is no access to IMAP/SMTP or something
       similar for the free plan users. Got to upgrade if we
       would like to use Proton Mail in other email clients.
       Anyway we could download its own email client.

APPS
       Proton VPN - haven't tried but I guess it works.

       Proton  Mail  - for free plan, this is the only email
       client supporting Proton Mail accounts.

SINS AND VIRTUES
       inspirationfeed.com

       The seven cardinal sins: pride, greed,  wrath,  lust,
       envy, gluttony and sloth.

       Lust  refers  to an intense desire, usually to engage
       in illegal or immoral sexual pleasure.

       Gluttony refers to the  overconsumption  of  food  or
       anything to the point of waste.

       Greed  is  an  intense desire and passionate love for
       material wealth. Much like lust and  gluttony,  greed
       results from an irrational longing for what you don't
       need.

       Sloth is laziness as is  manifested  by  the  willful
       avoidance  of work. It stems from the desire to avoid
       responsibility. One adage that aptly captures the sin
       of sloth is, 'those who do not work should not eat.'

       Wrath  is simply uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage
       or hatred. Wrath feeds on a strong  desire  to  exact
       vengeance  and is often fueled by an irrational drive
       to harm others.

       Wrath  counterparts:  gentleness,  self-control,  pa-
       tience and peace.

       Scriptural   references:  Colossians  3:8,  Ephesians
       4:26-27, James  1:19-20,  Proverbs  14:29  and  15:1,
       Psalm 37:8 and Romans 12:19.

       Envy is the desire for possessions, happiness as well
       as the talents and abilities of others.

       Pride is defined as an excessive  love  for  oneself,
       belief in one's abilities, the desire to excel every-
       one else.  Pride is such a vile sin that it has often
       been considered as the root cause of the other six of
       the seven cardinal sins.

       The seven heavenly virtues: prudence,  justice,  tem-
       perance, courage, faith, hope and charity.
