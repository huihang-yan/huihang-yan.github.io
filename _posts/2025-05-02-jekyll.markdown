What can we write in GitHub Pages?
In the document Quickstart for GitHub Pages, we have the answer:

> You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects,
> host a blog, or even share your resume.

Yes, we could use GitHub Pages as blog. That is great - especially
considering the fact that for some reason - probably the national firewall
- I could not connect to neither Blogspot and Wordpress.

The document link is: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

The posts are put in the `_posts` directory.
They would automatically update if we use 
`jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates the site 
when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number,
 `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers,
 and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
 After that, include the necessary front matter.
It would be easier to just grab a existing source and take a look at the
format.

Code snippets syntax test:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
